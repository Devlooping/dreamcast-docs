<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">At this story being popular, it 
administered to also DC of the acquaintance, but it seems that is not big 
problem.<br>
When we assume, that there is a problem, it is the point where entry to visual 
memory <b>a little </b>becomes <b>unstable</b>.<font size="-1">(As for reading 
OK!)</font><br>
<font size="-1">(And, the consequence or liquid crystal indication to which 
access speed to visual memory rises part becomes strange, but there is no 
influence in play.)</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">Perhaps, this problem, the visual memory 
where I purchase to be to place <b>early type</b>, but with those which recently 
become sale it seems that is not problem. (Indication is strange after all, is, 
but. . . .)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">The remodelling other DC it increased, 
but with the lot which is different it does not do heat dissipation measure and 
the &#12390; andthose <b>240Mhz operation</b> <b>there is no problem </b>it is and, 
240Mhz operation <b>how doing, </b>it seems that is some which <b>are not

Me in the past, as for CPU which was used with the personal computer,<br>
Pentium 133Mhz -&gt; <b>180Mhz</b>MMX Pentium 233Mhz -&gt; it moved with <b>290Mhz </b>
without problem. <br>
(Presently you have used, as for K6-2 400Mhz, above 400Mhz it does not 
stabilize. (+_+) )</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">As for the latest remodelling DC, with 
the relationship which shaves margin with <font color="Red"><b>heat generation</b>
