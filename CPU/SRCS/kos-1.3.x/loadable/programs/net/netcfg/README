This program implements a basic network configuration tool. It is PVR and
controller based, and requires nothing of the DC or environment beyond
providing a monitor and controller or keyboard. It will attempt to load
a previous config from any attached VMUs or the CD root, and failing that
it'll create a default config.

Once you've completed your settings, select Save to write it out to the
first attached VMU (it scans ports A to D and then units 1 to 6). This
config will then be used when starting KOS networking.

As mentioned in the sources, this tool is a bit of overkill for what it
does, and is probably much larger than it really needs to be. It's intended
to be loaded from a CD once in a while and then forgotten. But it also
serves as a nice Tsunami example, and pulls in some more code from FoF.
