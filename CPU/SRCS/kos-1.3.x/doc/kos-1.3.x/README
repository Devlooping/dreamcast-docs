The files in this dir are mostly internal notes for me (Dan) so I can keep
my thoughts straight and plan during the reworking of some parts of KOS
for 1.3.x. I figured they might be interesting to others though, and this
is much easier for backing up :) so here they are.

If you want a user-level intro to 1.3.x, check user_intro.txt.
