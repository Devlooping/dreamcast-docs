Minimalistic README for DreamIce


This is a work in progress. The program is distributed under the MIT licensing
terms. Basically they say that you can do whatever you want to with this, as
long as you don't change it and then distribute it saying that it's the
same program (i.e., you claim it's the original "DreamIce") or that you
change it and say that you wrote it. Additionally, there is NO WARRANTY on
the program or its functionality.

DreamIce is not portable. In fact, it doesn't even make any pretensions, 
despite the fact that it's written in C. It will only compile on GNU C,
and it will only run on little-endian 32-bit systems. Which basically
means Cygwin, Linux/x86, and *BSD/x86. It may run on other 32-bit processors
if they are configured in little-endian mode (ARM, SH4, PPC, etc). I have
no idea though =).

Have fun, and I'd be interested to hear if you make anything cool with this!
The license itself is not restrictive at all, but if you make anything with
it then please consider releasing it with the same license so we can all
benefit.
