<? heading("Welcome"); ?>

<p>KallistiOS is a pro-grade development system for consoles. There exist
ports to the Dreamcast(tm), Gameboy Advance(tm), Playstation 2(tm), and
x86-based PCs, though the DC port is the only one that can claim any sort
of completeness right now, so pretty much all the rest of these web pages
are devoted to the Dreamcast port.</p>

<p>The GBA port is based on an older version (1.2.x) and has forked off to be
maintained by Gil Megidish. A link to that project will be posted when
I've got it.</p>

<p>KOS has been used to produce <a href="http://www.feetoffury.com/">commercial
quality games</a> for sale.</p>

<p>KOS was developed from scratch over the internet by a group of free
software developers, and has no relation to the old Katana or WinCE
development kits for the DC (besides having a similar purpose anyway). 
It also has no relation at all with the unfortunately named "Kalisto"
crack group.</p>

<p>KOS is free software. This means you get the full source code for it and
can do whatever the heck you want with it except for incorporating it into
your own program without credit. As long as you have those magic credit
lines somewhere in your program, you are free to include it in any other
free software project (GPL'd or otherwise), commercial project, whatever
you want.</p>

<p>On the other hand, KOS comes with <b>NO WARRANTY</b>. If you use it, you
use it at your own risk. Check out the source license for more details. Also
please be aware that KOS is bundled with various "ports" which may have
different licenses (e.g., GPL). If you use those libraries, <b>please</b>
check the license to make sure.</p>


<? heading("Topics"); ?>

<p>These web pages have been organized into sections by topic to make it
easier to find what you want. People who are new to DC homebrew development
should start at the top. Otherwise you probably know where you need to
start.</p>

<p><ul>

<li><a href="scene.php">The DC "Scene"</a>: Just heard about this "DC Scene"
thing and want to know what it's all about and why you might be interested
in joining it?</li>

<li><a href="howtogetit.php">How to get it</a>: This tells where and how you
can find KOS for download.</li>

<li><a href="setup.php">Compilation/Setup</a>: This tells the basics
of going from a set of downloaded files to a working DC dev setup using
KOS. Note that if you haven't downloaded anything yet and want to use
an automated setup script, you can start here.</li>

<li><a href="faq.php">FAQ</a>: Frequently asked questions by both new and
experienced developers. Check here if you're having troubles.</li>

<li><a href="list.php">Mailing lists/Forums</a>: If you're going to use KOS for
more than a hard disk ornament, please join the KOS mailing list. It's
generally very friendly (especially to beginners) and is definitely the
quickest way to get help (generally even faster than mailing me). Plus
there's a wide variety of people on these that can help with a lot of
different topics.</li>
