ps2-load-ip is a mish-mash of code pulled from all over the place in a 
frenzy of late-night coding. :) As an unfortunate result, it contains code
from 3 distinctive free software licenses. I figured the complexity of this
situation warranted a whole directory for license things. Thankfully they
are all compatible with (or are) the GPL, so you can distribute the entire
thing under the terms of the GPL.

However, you may want to pull pieces of the code for use in your own
projects. To this end, I've carefully marked each piece of code as to who
has copyrights on it and what the license is for that file. "BSD" means
a BSD-compatible license (without the advertising clause), "GPL" means
the GNU Public License, and "RHEPL" means the Red Hat eCos Public License.

All of the code originally written by me (Dan Potter) and the code pulled
from KOS is BSD-style licensed.

Some of the pieces pulled from eCos were somewhat sketchy on the actual
license details, but I'm assuming that since they were patches for a version
of eCos post-GPL-switchover, they are probably meant to be licensed under
the GPL themselves.

If you are the author of some piece of code in this and I screwed up
your credits, copyrights, license, whatever, then please feel free to
contact me and I will fix it ASAP.

Files in this dir:

   KOS   --  BSD style license for non-Regents files (those have their own
     license included in the file itself)
   GPL   --  GPL v2
   RHEPL --  Red Hat eCos Public License
