This is my bootstrap loader for my DC Navi project. It can probably be
adapted and used for other DCs with the BIOS replaced by flash. The
font is a rasterized copy of the "Neep" 12x24 Bold font, from Jim
Knoble's GPL'd X11 font package. You can edit this image and use font_cvt
to convert it to a bin file, which can then be built into the bootstrap
image, if you want to replace the font, add more chars, etc.
