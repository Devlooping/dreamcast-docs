This is the same example included in kos:
kos\examples\dreamcast\2ndmix

However, the source code for the ARM program was not included,
instead only the compiled header.

There exists a non-compiling LibS3M:
kos-ports\libs3m

I have made a new makefile for the ARM code from LibS3M.
2ndmix\s3mplay\Makefile

This will build the ARM program, stream.drv

Use the custom version of 'bin2c' I have included
2ndmix\s3mplay\bin2c

to convert the stream.drv into s3mplay.h with this command:
bin2c stream.drv s3mplay.h s3mplay
