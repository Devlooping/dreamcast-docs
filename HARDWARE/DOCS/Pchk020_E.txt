<< Drawing (without Kamui) >>

 - Kamui is being used to access the drawing system register when the graphic 
  chip for the development target differs from the product version.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* The following check items will become valid when the same graphic chip is used 
  for development targets and product versions.  Until then, Kamui must be used as 
  shown above.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Soft reset and register settings are being initialized before TA transfer.
 - During Ch2 DMA, suspension of Ch2 DMA is being confirmed and a soft reset is being
  used to empty TA FIFO upon forcible interruption of TA.
 - When using user tile clipping, more than 1 invisible dummy polygon is being sent
  before setting global parameters to change items such as the area.
 - Direct data (such as texture) is being sent while YUV macro block send is 
  in progress.
 - End of TSP is being used for drawing complete interrupt. 
 - The display area is set to the drawing area minus 1 when the y scale is reduced.
 - An invisible opaque polygon that covers the entire screen is registered when using
  presorted half-transparent polygons.
 - Half-transparent sorting mode is set to auto sort when using modifiers 
  with half-transparent and tri-linear polygons.
 - Intensity shadow volume is being used for polygons that use bump map texture. 
 - The nu screen is being divided into an even number of sections when strip buffer 
  mode is being used for the frame buffer.  
 - The value set for FB_X_CLIP or FB_Y_CLIP exceeds the screen size when using strip 
  buffer mode for the frame buffer.

<< SH4 >>

 - The SAR, DAR, DMATCR, and CHCR registers of SH4-DMA are only being rewritten 
  when the CHCR DE bit is set to 0.
 - DMA for channels 1 and 3 is being used in accordance with the workaround described
  under "Failure to write peripheral module control register during DMA transfer" 
  in the manual.
 - An NMI has been generated during DMA. 
 - Flash memory is not being accessed before setting G1FRC and G1FWC.
 - 32-byte access to system ROM is not being used before setting G1FRC and G1FWC. 
 - Only system ROM is being accessed before setting the CPU BSC.

<< File System >>

 - Two commands are not being written to the command register in immediate succession.
 - Undefined commands are not being issued.
 - Commands are not being issued with incorrect parameters. 
 - Operation is being implemented according to protocol.
 - Data registers are being accessed in words and other registers are being accessed 
  in bytes.
 - ROM and FLASH are not being accessed during DMA. 
 - The transfer mode (feature register) is set correctly.
 - G1 Bus is set correctly.
 - The drive select register is not being accessed.
 - Error processing is working properly with all commands. 

<< Peripherals >>

 - The command that indicates the end of each command in the command file is located 
  at the 8th long word of a 32-byte boundary.
 - The command file is composed of long word units.  
 - A storage address indicated for received data in the command file is at a 32-byte 
  boundary 
 - The address of the Maple register in the command file starts with 0x0???????. 
 - DMA is being disabled when writing values to the system control and DMA trigger 
  selection registers.

<< Sound >>

 -  When accessing sound memory and registers, long access (4-byte) is always being 
  done using 4-byte boundaries.
 - Sound memory is being accessed through the cache through area. 
 - Addresses other than those of defined memory and registers are not being accessed. 
 -  After data has been written to sound memory, FIFO is being checked to ensure 
  that it is empty before doing read operations. 
 -  FIFO is being checked to ensure that it is empty when writes to sound memory are
  performed more than 9 times in succession.
 -  Before reset/control of the sound CPU, VREG contents in the same register are always 
  saved. 
 -  When reading RTC data, measures are being taken to ensure that data being read is 
not invalid because it is in the process of being updated. (such as reading the 
data twice and verifying that it is the same). 
 - Sound system internal DMA is being used.
