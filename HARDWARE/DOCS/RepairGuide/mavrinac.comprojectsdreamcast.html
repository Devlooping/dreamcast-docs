<center><h1>Dreamcast Dissection</h1></center>

<hr>

<p>This is a breakdown of the electronic anatomy of the Sega Dreamcast console system.</p>

<hr>

<p>Fortunately, the internals of the Dreamcast are easy to remove and replace. There are six types of screws in the system, but they are all Phillips heads. All of them are straightforward, except three. The first is one of the four outer shell screws, which is located under the modem or broadband adapter. The second and third are two of the screws hoding the electrical shield on the GD-ROM drive board together. Their heads are buried under the black foam padding on one end; the easiest way to unscrew them is just to puncture the foam with the screwdriver and unscrew until the shield halves separate. The rest should be pretty easy to figure out.</p>

<h4>1. Mainboard</h4>

<p>At the center of the Dreamcast mainboard is the Hitachi SH-4 CPU, with a clock speed of 200 MHz. The board also contains 16 MB of main RAM, the NEC PowerVR graphics card with 8 MB of VRAM, and the Yamaha sound controller with 2 MB RAM. There are external connectors for AV output and serial communication, as well as the connector for the modem (6) or broadband adapter. There is also an internal connector for communication with the GD-ROM drive board (2), a 20-conductor ribbon to the controller port board (4) and six vertical pins that couple to the power supply (5).</p>

<h4>2. GD-ROM Drive Board</h4>

<p>This board sits above the mainboard (1) and is connected to it by the white data interface connector. It communicates with the GD-ROM spindle and reader (3) on a 16-conductor ribbon, and provides two power connectors for it. Switch S1, located in the top right corner of the board, tells the GD-ROM drive that the top cover is closed. Hacks involving modification or replacement of the case may require its contacts to be switched from some other location.</p>

<h4>3. GD-ROM Spindle & Reader</h4>

<p>The spindle assembly sits on the GD-ROM drive board (2), and is connected to it by a 16-conductor ribbon and two power connectors (a 2-pin for the electronics, and a 4-pin for the spindle motor). It can be moved to another location by changing or extending the ribbon interface, provided there is still adequate slack in the ribbon for the read head to slide along its track.</p>

<h4>4. Controller Port Board</h4>

<p>This unit contains four female 5-pin Dreamcast controller jacks. The jacks can be removed from the board and connected to their pins with leads if they need to be moved, for example to case mod the Dreamcast. The board also contains the rechargeable 3V battery and the red power LED. It is possible to replace the battery with two AA or AAA rechargeables. One simple and popular hack is replacing the LED with a different color (blue looks cool); just make sure the new one supports 3.3V. If you are case modding the Dreamcast, you can remove the LED and run leads from the terminal points to the location of the new power LED. The board is connected to the front end of the mainboard (1) by a 20-conductor ribbon.</p>

<h4>5. Power Supply</h4>

<p>The Dreamcast power supply provides the mainboard and its peripherals with DC 3.3V, 5V, 12V, and their respective grounds. It has a 2-pin power cable connector at the back, a 2-pin block near the back for the power switch, and a 6-pin connector block at the front that mates with the vertical pins on the mainboard (1). The power switch can be replaced with any switch; just add the mating connector to the new switch's leads.</p>

<h4>6. Modem</h4>

<p>The modem contains one external RJ-11 jack. It is connected to the mainboard (1) by the Dreamcast peripheral interface.</p>

<h4>7. Cooling Fan</h4>

<p>This is a 5V 80mA fan, connected to the controller port board (4) by a 3-pin power connector. The power leads can be extended fairly easily, or the fan can be omitted or replaced. If the angled "duct" attached to the outward flow side causes problems with case modding, it is only held on by two screws and can be removed.</p>
