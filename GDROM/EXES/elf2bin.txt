Here is a little batch file that will belp people convert
Dreamcast elf files to bin files to burn to a cd.




INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:
---------------------

Open the elf2bin.bat file in notepad/whatever then edit the names of the files to match your's.

---------------------

I know this can normally only be done by people who have dcdev cygwin environments set up,
but there are enough files here to do the job.

Have fun!!!!



DISCLAIMER AND COPYRIGHT:
------------------------

I take no responsibility for any damage, either physical or in software to your PC, or dreamcast.

cygwin1.dll is from:     http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/
sh-elf-objcopy.exe is from gcc I think.   I'm not exactly sure :(  :  http://gcc.gnu.org/
