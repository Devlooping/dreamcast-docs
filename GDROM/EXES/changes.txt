V4.2 : 17 nov 06

Changes :
- replaced old cdi2nero and cdi2tao with newer cdi2nero (0.9.9). it added a "-t" switch to 
  generates a TAO image from command line. Now all generation image (CDI, NRG TAO and DAO) uses 
  CDI4DC, so ... bin2boot's gone for good.
- new generation process... check it yourself.

v4.1 : 12 nov 06

Changes :
 - Replaced bin2boot by cdi4dc for the DiscJuggler creation image procedure *ONLY*
   (cdi2nero and cdi2tao.exe don't support CDI v4.0 images).
 - The combobox has the first item selected by default
 - Some GFX and version info changes...
