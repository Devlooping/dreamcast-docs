General Information
===================

PAL-enforcer is a program intended to make NTSC titles work
on TVs that can only handle 50Hz (like my parents' old one).
It does this by intercepting any writes to the hardware-register
that controls the output frequency and ensure that it is always
set to 50Hz. Unfortunately it doesnt change the colour encoding
so picture may be in black & white; PAL-enforcer is really a bit
of a misnomer. It overrides the region-lockout allowing games from
all territories to be played. (This last part comes with a big
caveat; it is only known to work with a Japanese Ver.1.004 bootROM
by patching an instruction that might very well be in different
locations in other versions of the ROM...)


Installation
============

See the file 'INSTALL' for detailed instructions


Usage
=====

After compiling, the program should be burned onto a CD that
can be booted on the DC. After booting, replace the CD with
the game to be played (will only work with a original GDROMs
though I make no guarantee about WindowsCE games since I don't
have any of those) and hopefully the game will boot in 50 Hz
mode.
