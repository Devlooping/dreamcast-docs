This is little more than some hacky test code that I'm using to get a better
handle on Kallistios, and Blender.  I use Blender 2.12 to make low poly
objects which I then apply texture.  The textures are created with Gimp =)

I've created a simple python script that exports the mesh, face indices, and
uv texture mapping coordinates in the form of a "C" header file.  You can
find everything in the resources directory.

I'm no artist, and not a programmer either. This is a hobby for me, but I
do intend to write a few games for the DC. I'm currently working on a 3D space
invaders type of shoot'em up.

Compiled under:
Kallistios 1.1.4
binutils 2.11.2
gcc 2.95.3 20010315 (release)
libstc++ 2.92
newlib 1.9.0

Blender is available at http://www.blender.nl
The current version is 2.20, but my script will not work under it. You will
need an earlier version, but I suggest nothing older than 2.12. I'll
eventually rewrite the script to work with 2.20, but if you're in the mood
to do it your self I'd love to get a copy 8D

Long live the GPL, OpenSource, and all the folks who make this all possible.
