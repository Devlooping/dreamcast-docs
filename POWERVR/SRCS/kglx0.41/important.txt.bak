IMPORTANT NOTES
----------------
V0.4: works with KOS 1.2.0. fixed GL_QUADS clipping!

V0.3: fixed GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP and GL_TRIANGLE z_near clipping.
PLEASE NOTE: only those primitives have z_near clipping for now!!!!!!

V0.21: since V0.0 clipping of TRIANGLE STRIPS and FANS is broken.
I will fix this very soon.

V0.2:
kfeatures.h change max. nr. of displaylists is you like!
just de- or increase this value before compiling the library

V0.0:

-glOrtho*() does not work well I guess. Just use
GL_NT_FLATFAN/GL_NT_FLATSTRIP/GL_NT_QUADS primitives for 2D
graphics!

-NEAR_Z clipping is OFF by default!
Turn it on with glEnable(GL_KOS_NEARZ_CLIPPING) and off with
glDisable(GL_KOS_NEARZ_CLIPPING)
