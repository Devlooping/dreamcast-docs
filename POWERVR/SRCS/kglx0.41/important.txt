IMPORTANT NOTES
----------------

V0.41:



this primitives are fully supported:
	GL_TRIANGLE,
	GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP,
	GL_QUADS,
															
this primitives are supported , but does not 
clip (in fact the faces are not rendered if there is ZNEAR clipping needed):
															
GL_TRIANGLE_FAN
															
													
this primitives are not supported:
															
GL_QUAD_STRIP,
GL_LINE
															

V0.2:
kfeatures.h change max. nr. of displaylists is you like!
just de- or increase this value before compiling the library

V0.0:

-glOrtho*() does not work well I guess. Just use
GL_NT_FLATFAN/GL_NT_FLATSTRIP/GL_NT_QUADS primitives for 2D
graphics!

-NEAR_Z clipping is OFF by default!
Turn it on with glEnable(GL_KOS_NEARZ_CLIPPING) and off with
glDisable(GL_KOS_NEARZ_CLIPPING)
