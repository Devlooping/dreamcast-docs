DirectSound sample program -- PlayMultipleSounds
-----------------------------------------

* Purpose:
This sample demonstrates how to play multiple sounds simultaneously in a
separate thread.  It creates an empty sound buffer for each of the
Dreamcast's channels, and copies active sounds into those buffers as
they are played.  The sounds are loaded from the resource file.

Pressing the "A", "B", "X", and "Y" buttons on a controller plugged into
the Dreamcast will cause different sounds to be played.

* Required Files\Parameters:
None

* To exit this sample, press the 'Send ESC' button in DCTool or
press <Esc> on the keyboard
