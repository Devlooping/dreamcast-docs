Direct3D sample program -- bumpmapping
-----------------------------------------

* Purpose:
This sample demonstrates how to use bumpmapping mapping on WinCE
for Dreamcast.  


The sample displays two spheres. Both are bumpmapping-mapped and conventionally
textured. The sphere on the right uses a texture which contains alpha and
this sphere is alpha blended. The sphere on the left is opaque.
A "bumpmapping light" rotates diagonally in front of, then behind the scene.
