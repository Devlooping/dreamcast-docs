KAMUI Software Developers Kit
******************************
  
KAMUI2 POWERVR DEMOS:

CHEAPBUMP:
	Bump map demo using fast bumping technique.

DRAGONFLY:
	Motion-blur demo using render to a texture.
	Note: This demo takes about 20 minutes to be built using CodeWarrior IDE due to a bug in the compiler.

FORTUNE:
	Gigapixel fill-rate demo.
	Every card is built with three layers, one opaque and two translucent.
	This demo shows a fill rate of more than 1100 Mpps.

MATERIALS:
	Example that shows perception differences of different materials using bump mapping.

KNOT:
	Simple bump-map demo.
 					
SCANNER:
	Generic modifier volume demo.

SIBERIAN:
	Punchtrough demo. 

TRILINEAR:
	Translucent and opaque trilinear.

VASE:
	Accumulation buffer for blending.
	This demo shows how to cut out an environment map using a 4444 map.

WHEEL:
	'Realistic' bump-map demo.
         
WRACE:
	User defined table fog.

LIGHTBEAM:
	This demo shows how to create lights using cheap-shadows.

TEXTUREFORMATS:
	A little test that shows YUV, VQ, 565, 1555, 4444 and Palettize textures.
	All of them created on the fly from 24-bits bitmap sources.

MIPMAPPING:
	2x2, 4x4 and Fourier mipmapping.

SHADY:
	How to pre-sort translucent projected shadows over a flat surface.

SHADYTEXTURE:
        Dinamic shadow using render to a texture.

FOURPASSES:
        Pre-sorted and auto-sorted polygons mixed in the same scene.
	
Notes:
	Only Kamui2 graphic functions have been used to build these demos.
	The include files with the 3D and texture data have been created using
	the plug-in for 3DStudioMAX called PVRexp.dle (You can find in the 
        utl\gfx\conv\3DS2Kamui).
