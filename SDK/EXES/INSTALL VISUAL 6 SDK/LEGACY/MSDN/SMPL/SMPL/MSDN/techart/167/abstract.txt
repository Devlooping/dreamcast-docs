HierList: Displays Hierarchical List in Owner-Drawn List
Box

HierList implements a hierarchical list box that includes
icon bitmaps and connecting lines. It demonstrates what an
application must do to display the hierarchy and includes
some helper functions developed to make the process easier
for the application developer.

HierList is a companion sample application for the
"Displaying a Hierarchy in a List Box" technical article
on the Microsoft(R) Developer Network CD.
 
HierList was built and tested under Microsoft Windows(TM)
version 3.1. The sample also builds and runs under
Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0 and Visual C++ version 1.0.
