 EasyDIB is a version of the EasyGL sample application that
 demonstrates how to use Microsoft(R) Windows(R) device-
 independent bitmaps (DIBs) with OpenGL(TM). EasyDIB uses
 GLlib.DLL, which contains a class library for OpenGL.
 EasyDIB loads Windows DIBs and displays them, by using the
 glDrawPixels function.
 
 For more information on EasyDIB, refer to the "OpenGL V:
 Translating Windows DIBs" technical article in the
 Microsoft Development Library. EasyGL is discussed in the
 "OpenGL III: Building an OpenGL C++ Class" technical
 article in the Development Library.
 
 EasyDIB was built with Microsoft Visual C++(TM) version
 2.0 and the Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC)
 version 3.0, and tested under Microsoft Windows NT(TM)
 version 3.5, on the Intel(R), MIPS(R), and Alpha AXP(TM)
 platforms.
