OLEAUTO1: Demonstrate Using OLE Automation in COM Objects
The 32-bit VCDRAW and VBDRAW sample applications and their
associated DRAWING.DLL accompany the "MFC/COM Objects 7:
Creating and Using COM Objects with OLE Automation
Interfaces"msdn_oleauto1 technical article in the
Microsoft(R) Development Library. These samples show how OLE
Automation can be used in a simple Component Object Model
(COM) object to provide an interface that can be used from
both Microsoft Visual C++(TM) and Visual Basic(R)
applications.
Note that to run these samples, you must first register the
COM objects in the registry. Copy the executables and the
dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) to your local disk. Edit
DRAWING.REG to show the path to where you installed
DRAWING.DLL. Type "REGEDIT -s DRAWING.REG" (without the
quotation marks) in a command window to create the registry
entries.
Or, if you are brave, you can run the SETUP application in
the SETUP subdirectory, and this program will copy the files
and create the registry entries for you.
The VBDRAW sample was built with Microsoft Visual Basic
version 4.0. VCDRAW and DRAWING DLL were built with
Microsoft Visual C++ version 2.1. These samples were tested
under Microsoft Windows NT(TM).
Please also note that the version of Visual Basic 4.0 used
to build the sample is an internal beta. This sample is
provided as an illustration of what should be possible when
Visual Basic 4.0 ships.
