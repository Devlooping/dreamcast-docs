COMDLG32: Uses the Common Dialog Boxes Under Windows 95
COMDLG32 implements the common dialog boxes under the
Microsoft(R) Windows(R) 95 operating system in their simple
form, by using a hook and BY using templates. It also checks
the platform under which it is running to determine whether
to use the older-style dialog boxes (for Microsoft Windows
NT[TM]) or the new-look dialog boxes (under Windows 95).
COMDLG32 is a companion sample for the "Using the Common
Dialogs Under Windows 95"msdn_cmndlg32 technical article in
the Microsoft Development Library.
COMDLG32 is a Microsoft Win32(R) Software Development Kit
(SDK) sample. It was built with Microsoft Visual C++(TM)
version 2.1, the 32-bit development system for Microsoft
Windows, Windows 95, and Windows NT, and was tested under
Windows 95.
