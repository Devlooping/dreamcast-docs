CALLB: Demonstrates Member Functions As Callbacks

CALLB demonstrates how to handle callbacks with C++ member
functions. It is a companion application for the technical
article, "Calling All Members: Member Functions as
Callbacks."

Microsoft(R) Windows(TM) version 3.1 has over 30 callback
functions that applications can use to enumerate objects,
hook into the hardware, and perform a variety of other
activities. The article explains why normal member
functions cannot be used as callback functions and gives
several techniques for handling callbacks. The article and
source code are targeted toward Microsoft C/C++ version
7.0, but the ideas presented apply to all C++ compilers,
including those by Borland and Zortech.

CALLB contains eight make files that create six
executables: MAKE1 creates CPROG1; MAKE2 generates a
compile-time error and does not create an executable;
MAKE3, MAKE4, MAKE5, and MAKE6 create CPROG3, CPROG4,
CPROG5, and CPROG6, respectively; and TMAKE creates
CTIMER. Please refer to "Calling All Members: Member
Functions as Callbacks" for more information.

NOTE:  Running CPROG1 generates a GP fault by design.

CALLB was built and tested under Microsoft Windows version
3.1.
