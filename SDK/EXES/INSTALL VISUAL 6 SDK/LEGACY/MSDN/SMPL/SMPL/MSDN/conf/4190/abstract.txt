 FX205 demonstrates the following programs--DOCVCX.PRG,
 FOXTABLE.PRG, and OLECLASS.PRG--that augment the "Using
 OLE in Microsoft Visual FoxPro" technical presentation
 given by Paul Bienick at the Tech*Ed Conference held March
 27-31, 1995 in New Orleans, Louisiana.
 
 The source code for the DOCVCX.PRG and FOXTABLE.PRG
 programs will need to be examined before run either
 program. These source files have hard-coded variables that
 you may need to change.
 
 The session and the examples focus on OLE Automation. They
 illustrate how to use the power built into other
 Microsoft(R) Office products (such as Microsoft Word and
 Microsoft Excel) in your own FoxPro(R) application.
 
 For more information, please refer to the technical
 presentation, which is also available in the Microsoft
 Development Library (Conferences and Seminars, Tech*Ed,
 March 1995).
