WACCDEMO: Uses the Word 95 Access Object as an OLE 
Automation Server 
The WACCDEMO sample application demonstrates the use of the Microsoft(R) Word 95 Access object as 
an OLE Automation server. This sample uses Microsoft Visual Basic(R) version 4.0 as the OLE 
Automation controller. Developers can use this sample to gain a better understanding of how to implement 
OLE Automation with the Word 95 Access object.
WACCDEMO is a companion sample for the "Using Microsoft OLE Automation Servers to Develop 
Solutions" technical article in the Microsoft Development Library.
Note that you must have the Data Access Object version 3.0, Microsoft Word 95, the Microsoft Access 95 
NORTHWIND.MDB sample database, and their associated type libraries fully installed on your system to 
run this sample.
The WACCDEMO sample was built with the Enterprise Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic version 4.0 and 
tested on Microsoft Windows(R) 95.
