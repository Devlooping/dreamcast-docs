 Scroll32: Implements 32-Bit Scrolling
 
 Scroll32 implements 32-bit scrolling and thumb tracking
 for Microsoft(R) Windows NT(TM). In Win32(R), you can use
 32-bit values to set the range and position of the thumb
 in the scroll bar. However, if you are doing real-time
 thumb tracking using the SB_THUMBTRACK message, Win32 will
 give you only 16 bits of position data. This is because
 the position data is returned in the HIWORD of the lParam.
 To get around this limitation, you need to approximate the
 position yourself. One way to do this is to get the
 current cursor position, map it to the scroll window, and
 calculate the position based on the ratio between the
 mouse position in the scroll bar window and the point
 within the range of the scroll bar
 
 The Scroll32 sample demonstrates this technique. Run this
 sample and drag the mouse along either the vertical or
 horizontal scroll bar. You will see the scroll position
 updated in the text at the bottom of the screen. You can
 also set a specific scroll range and scroll position with
 this sample.
 
 Scroll32 is a companion sample for the "Scroll Bar
 Controls in Win32"msdn_scroll32 technical article in the
 Microsoft Development Library.
 
 Scroll32 was built under Microsoft Visual C++(TM) for
 Windows NT and tested under Microsoft Windows NT version
 3.1. Make files for Visual C++ for Windows NT and the
 Win32 Software Development Kit tools are included.
