VDYNDEBD: Illustrates Dynamically Loadable VxDs for 
Windows 95
VDYNDEBD is a virtual device driver (VxD) written for the Microsoft(R) Windows(R) 95 
operating system. It illustrates three features: writing dynamically loadable VxDs for Windows 
95, loading such VxDs using the Win32(R) application programming interface (API), and 
supplying external WDEB386 commands in a VxD. The sample application also includes a 
simple Win32 application called LOADVXD, which can be used to load and unload VDYNDEBD.
The VDYNDEBD sample accompanies the "Enhancing WDEB386 with External Debugger 
Commands" technical article in the Microsoft Development Library.
Although VxDs for Windows 95 may be written in C/C++, VDYNDEBD is written in assembly 
language. The sample code is kept very small to give you an overview of the requirements for 
building a fully functional, dynamically loadable virtual device driver for Windows 95. The 
sample does not carry out any specific tasks, except to display a menu on the debug terminal 
when the user types the ".vdyndebd" command. You can use the sample source code as a 
template to build your own VxD.
VDYNDEBD.VXD was built using the Microsoft Windows 95 Device Driver Kit (DDK). The 
LOADVXD.EXE application was built using Microsoft Visual C++(TM) version 2.2 and the 
Microsoft Windows 95 Software Development Kit (SDK). This sample application was tested on 
Windows 95.
