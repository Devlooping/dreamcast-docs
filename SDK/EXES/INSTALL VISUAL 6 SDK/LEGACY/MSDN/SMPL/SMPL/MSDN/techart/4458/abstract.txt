VCMDDEMO: Uses the Voice Command Object as an OLE 
Automation Server 
The VCMDDEMO sample application demonstrates the use of the Voice Command object as an OLE 
Automation server. This sample uses Microsoft(R) Visual Basic(R) version 4.0 as the OLE Automation 
controller. Developers can use this sample to gain a better understanding of how to implement OLE 
Automation with the Voice Command object.
VCMDDEMO is a companion sample for the "Using Microsoft OLE Automation Servers to Develop 
Solutions" technical article in the Microsoft Development Library.
Note that you must have the Speech application programming interface (API) Software Development Kit 
(SDK), its supporting engines, and its associated type library fully installed on your system to run this 
sample.
The VCMDDEMO sample was built with the Enterprise Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic version 4.0 and 
tested on Microsoft Windows(R) 95.
