How the Single Window AppWizard was built:

File.New.Project.Custom AppWizard
	name: OneWndWz
	Your own custom steps
	called: Single Window AppWizard
	Custom steps: 1

Build the framework to ensure it's OK.
Copy files to the template dir
edit newproj.inf
add the files as TEMPLATE resources. Note: for .ico files you need to be
sure to import them as custom rather than auto. For each one imported set its ID value to it's 
name in quotes e.g. "mainfrm.cpp"

Edit each source file and use the $$root$$ macro instead of the app name 
in the template files.

Edit the custom dialog
Edit confirm.inf
Edit the help file.
