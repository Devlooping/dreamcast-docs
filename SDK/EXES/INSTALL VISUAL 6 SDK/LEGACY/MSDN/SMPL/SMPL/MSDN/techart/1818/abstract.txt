 THRD32: Demonstrates Processor Sharing in Windows NT
 
 Microsoft(R) Windows NT(TM) is a robust operating system
 that does not allow applications to completely shut down
 the system by hogging all the CPU time. However,
 unresponsive applications can undermine overall system
 performance and cause other applications to appear halted.
 THRD32 shows how to avoid these problems.
 
 THRD32 was built and tested under Microsoft Windows NT
 version 3.1.
