Flicker: Shows How to Update Screen Without Flickers

Flicker is a companion sample application for the "Flicker-
Free Displays Using an Off-Screen DC" technical article on
the Microsoft(R) Developer Network CD.

Many applications written for the Microsoft Windows(TM)
operating system maintain status information such as the
current time in a small control window that flickers very
 annoyingly each time it's updated. All standard Windows
controls flicker if updated at frequent intervals. The
solution to this problem is to implement a simple control
and use an off-screen device context (DC) to construct the
image, which is then copied in total to the client area of
the control window. The net result is a control that can
be updated without causing any flicker.

Flicker has window procedures for two controls--one of
these flickers; the other one doesn't. The application
creates an instance of each of these controls and updates
the window text ten times every second to show how one
flickers and the other doesn't. Both controls support the
system text color, window background color, and the
WM_SETTEXT and WM_SETFONT messages.

Flicker was built and tested under Microsoft Windows
version 3.1 and the Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0 compiler.
