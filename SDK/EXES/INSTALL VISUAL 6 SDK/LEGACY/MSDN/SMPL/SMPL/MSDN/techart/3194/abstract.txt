 GLEasy is a Microsoft(R) Foundation Class Library (MFC)
 application that just happens to include some OpenGL(TM)
 code for placing a cube, a pyramid, and a dodecadedron on
 the screen. You can even rotate these objects. GLEasy is a
 good place to start exploring OpenGL. Everything is set up
 for OpenGL to work correctly; all you have to do is add
 your own OpenGL code to render any scene you like.
 
 GLEasy accompanies the "OpenGL I: Quick Start" and "OpenGL
 II: Windows Palettes and RGBA Mode" technical articles in
 the Microsoft Development Library.
 
 To make it easy for you to follow the discussions in my
 two articles, I put all the relevant code in the GLEasy
 view class CGLEasyView, in the GLEASVW.H and GLEASVW.CPP
 files.
 
 GLEasy was built using Microsoft Visual C++(TM) version
 2.0, and tested under Windows NT(TM) version 3.5.
