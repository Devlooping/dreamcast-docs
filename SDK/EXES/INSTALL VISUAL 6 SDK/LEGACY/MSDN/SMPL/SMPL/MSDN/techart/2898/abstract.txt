 This Win32-based application, built with Visual C++(TM)
 (32-bit) on Windows NT(TM) version 3.5 (beta), accompanies
 the technical article “Recording and Playing Waveform
 Audio.”
 
 The Speller application demonstrates playback and uses the
 spelling list created by the SpelEdit application. Speller
 plays word sounds from the list and requires the user to
 type them correctly before moving to the next word. Help
 for the user is provided by playing portions of speech
 that are included as WAVE resources in the application.
 
 KEYWORDS: sound; Win32
