The build order for the Layered Shell files is:

01=RegSvc
02=LogSvc\Errs
03=LogSvc\Info
04=LogSvc\Data
05=LogSvc
06=ErrSvc\ErrRes
07=ErrSvc
08=DbsSvc\DbsJet
09=DbsSvc\DbsRdo
10=DbsSvc
11=SysSvc

Alternatively, you can simply use a registry editor (regedit) to register the
compiled dll files in your system.
If you opt to rebuild the files independantly, you will need to re-connect
the references to manually.

Enjoy!
