EZPRINT: Prints Text, Rectangles, and Lines

EZPRINT, a framework for implementing more sophisticated
printing capabilities, demonstrates starting a print job,
printing various objects on the page, and ending the print
job.

Printing from applications written for the Microsoft(R)
Windows(TM) version 3.1 operating system can be trying at
times. EZPRINT provides three exported functions
(StartDocument, PrintObject, and EndDocument), and sample
dynamic-link library (DLL) code and Visual Basic(TM) code.
You can use the DLL as is or modify it to meet your needs.

EZPRINT is a companion sample application for the
"EZPRINT: No-Frills Printing in Visual Basic and C"
technical article on the Microsoft Developer Network CD.

EZPRINT was built and tested under Microsoft Windows
version 3.1 and Microsoft Visual Basic 1.0 and Visual
Basic 2.0.
