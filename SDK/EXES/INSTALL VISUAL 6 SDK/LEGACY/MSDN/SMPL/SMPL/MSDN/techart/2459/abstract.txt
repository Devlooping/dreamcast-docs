 MYGL: Sample OpenGL Application
 
 MYGL is an OpenGL sample application written in C++. This
 application runs on Microsoft(R) Windows NT(TM) version
 3.5 (code-named Daytona). However, it will not run on the
 first beta of Daytona. A class, COpenGL, was created for
 the purpose of the sample. It wraps the rendering context
 and pixel format management functions new to Windows NT.
 MYGL demonstrates the appropriate way to set up a pixel
 format, enumerate pixel formats, create rendering
 contexts, and destroy rendering contexts.
 
 MYGL is a companion sample for the “Windows NT OpenGL:
 Getting Started” technical article in the Microsoft
 Development Library.
 
 MYGL was built using the Microsoft Foundation Class
 Library (MFC).
