SMART ALLOC: Demonstrates _fmalloc and Microsoft(R)
Windows(TM)

Smart Alloc allows programmers to experiment using the
_fmalloc function in the Microsoft(R) Windows(TM)
operating system. It is a companion program for the
technical article "Allocating Memory the Old Fashioned
Way: _fmalloc and Applications for Windows."

With Smart Alloc and Heap Walker, programmers can
interactively explore the behavior of  _fmalloc, _ffree,
GlobalAlloc, GlobalFree, and _heapmin. They can allocate
memory either using GlobalAlloc or _fmalloc, or from a
DLL. They can determine when and how memory is allocated
easily, without recompiling.

The source code for Smart Alloc also demonstrates some
interesting features. Smart Alloc is a multiple-instance,
large-model application when compiled with Microsoft C/C++
version 7.0.  Another interesting feature of Smart Alloc
is that it includes a dynamic link library (DLL) that
intercepts all calls SMART.EXE makes to GlobalAlloc,
GlobalReAlloc, and GlobalFree.

Smart Alloc was built with Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0 and
tested under Microsoft Windows version 3.1.
