 The Gravity sample application demonstrates how to do
 sprite-style animation in Win32(R) using the Microsoft(R)
 Foundation Class Library (MFC). Gravity simulates the
 gravitational interactions of heavenly bodies.
 
 Gravity is a companion sample for the "Sprites Make the
 World Go Round" technical article in the Microsoft
 Development Library.
 
 The Gravity sample application is fairly easy to use.
 Choose the Load command from the File menu to load the
 EM.GVY (earth-moon) simulation. After loading, the screen
 should display a bitmap of space, the planet Earth, and
 the moon. Clicking the green button on the toolbar starts
 a simulation of the moon rotating around the earth.
 Clicking the red button on the toolbar stops the
 simulation. Clicking the button labeled X sets the planets
 back to their initial positions and velocity.
 
 Double-clicking a planet brings up a dialog box from which
 you can set the initial position, velocity, and the mass
 of the planets. You can use this dialog box to see how
 different masses and velocities affect the simulation.
 Take a look at EMC.BMP--it’s fun to see the interactions
 of three planets.
 
 If you want to create your own simulation, select the New
 command from the File menu. Load a background (such as
 SPACE.BMP) with the Load Background command from the File
 menu. Use the Load Sprite command from the File menu to
 load the planets that you want in your simulation. Double-
 click the sprites to set their parameters.
