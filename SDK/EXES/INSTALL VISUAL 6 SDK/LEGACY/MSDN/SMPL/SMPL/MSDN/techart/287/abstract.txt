DebugApp: High-Level Win32 Debugger

DebugApp is a high-level debugger that meets a number of
important requirements for the Microsoft(R) Win32(TM)
Application Programming Interface (API). It can debug
multiple applications simultaneously, controlling the
execution of each process being debugged and presenting
feedback on noteworthy events that occur in each process.
You can also use DebugApp to view the 2-GB heap space of
each process and learn how memory allocations are
organized. DebugApp stands on its own as a multiprocess
debugging application, but you can also use its source
code as the framework for a more elaborate custom
debugger.

DebugApp is a companion sample application for the "Win32
Debugging Application Programming Interface" technical
article on the Microsoft Developer Network CD.

DebugApp was built with the Microsoft Win32 Software
Development Kit (SDK) for Windows NT(TM) Beta Release
(March 1993). This sample application may be incompatible
with other releases of the Win32 SDK for Windows NT.
