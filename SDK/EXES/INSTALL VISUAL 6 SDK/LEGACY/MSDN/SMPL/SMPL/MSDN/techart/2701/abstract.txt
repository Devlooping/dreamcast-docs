 The PROPS sample application implements a simple property
 sheet in Chicago, which is the code name for the next
 version of the Microsoft(R) Windows(TM) operating system.
 A property sheet, also known as a tabbed dialog, is a
 window that allows the user to view and edit the
 properties of an item or an object. For example, a
 spreadsheet application can use a property sheet to allow
 the user to set the font and border properties of a cell.
 Property sheets are used extensively within the new
 Chicago shell to display and change the properties of
 shell items and the desktop. Application developers who
 want to give their software a consistent look and feel
 with the new shell are encouraged to use property sheets.
 
 PROPS is a companion sample for the "Win32 Common
 Controls, Part 6: Tab Controls and Property Sheets"
 technical article in the Microsoft Development Library.
 
 PROPS was built and tested under Chicago; however, the
 common control dynamic-link library (COMCTL32.DLL) that is
 included with Chicago will also be supported under
 Win32s(TM) running on Windows 3.1 and Windows NT(TM) via
 redistributable DLLs (just as the common dialogs were
 provided for Windows 3.0). It is important to note that
 these new common controls are 32-bit only and will not be
 supported for 16-bit Windows environments.
 
 WARNING: The PROPS executable file was built and tested
 using the Chicago Preliminary Development Kit. The
 executable will run only on Chicago; it will not run under
 Windows 3.1 or Windows NT. If you have Chicago installed
 on your machine, but you have problems running this
 sample, copy the project files to your system using the
 button below, rebuild the project, and run the executable.
