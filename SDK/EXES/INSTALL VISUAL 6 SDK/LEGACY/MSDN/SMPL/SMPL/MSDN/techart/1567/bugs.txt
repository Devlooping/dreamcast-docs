As objects are deleted, they do not get deleted from the storage
obejct so the disk file still contians them although they do not
apear in the OBJLIST and hence are not reloaded.

The info we put in the INFO stream of each object could be put
in the info we write to the OBJLIST

This would make the ole object storage obejcts tidier
