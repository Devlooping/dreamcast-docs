Installing the Visual Basic Application
------------------------------------------

1.  Run Setup.exe in the \setup folder. 

2.  Run the Billing.EXE program from the start menu.

3.  Enter the appropriate information in the VB form to test the functionality provided by 
    the Visual Basic server components that contain the business logic for the application.

4.  The \Source directory contains the Visual Basic 5 projects with source for the Visual 
    Basic executable application (Billing.exe), and the two ActiveX DLLs (creditcard.dll and 
    businessrules.dll) that provide the business services for both the VB application and 
    the Visual InterDev Web application.
