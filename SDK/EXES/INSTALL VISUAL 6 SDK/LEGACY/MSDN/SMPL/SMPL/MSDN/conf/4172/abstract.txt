 Word, and Microsoft Excel
 
 The AC203 sample application augments the "Building DDE
 and OLE Applications in Microsoft Office" technical
 presentation given by John Betz at the Tech*Ed Conference
 held March 27-31, 1995, in New Orleans, Louisiana.
 
 The presentation and samples illustrate two very powerful
 ways to communicate with other applications: OLE and
 dynamic data exchange (DDE).
 
 The examples in the AC203 project directory illustrate DDE
 and OLE communication with Microsoft(R) Word and Microsoft
 Excel. For more information, please refer to the technical
 presentation, which is available in the Microsoft
 Development Library (Conferences and Seminars, Tech*Ed,
 March 1995).
 
 AC203 was built with Microsoft Access(R) version 2.0.
