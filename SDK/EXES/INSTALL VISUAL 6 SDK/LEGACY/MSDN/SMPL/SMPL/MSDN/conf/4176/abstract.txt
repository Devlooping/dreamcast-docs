 Microsoft Access
 
 AC302 augments the "Client-Server Application Development
 Using Microsoft Access" technical presentation given by
 Christopher Payne at the Tech*Ed Conference held March 27-
 31, 1995, in New Orleans, Louisiana.
 
 This sample application provides information on how to
 design and develop client-server applications in
 Microsoft(R) Access(R) version 2.0.
 
 The original NWIND order form was rebuilt and optimized
 for the NWINDCS.MSB client-server environment. The
 original NWIND.MDB database was modified to run against a
 SQL Server-based data set. Note the technique used to
 alias tables and fields (a table is replaced by an
 aliasing query).
 
 The NWINDCS.SQL is a complete SQL dump of all tables,
 indexes, and stored procedures that completely recreate
 the functionality of the original NWIND.MDB database
 integrity including cascades. The file is in SQL Server
 Transact SQL.
 
 To run NWINDUP.MDB or NWINDCS.MDB, you need to create and
 populate your server database. If you need more detailed
 help migrating to SQL Server, please refer to the
 "Migrating Microsoft Access Tables to Database Servers"
 section in the technical presentation noted above. This
 presentation is also available in the Microsoft
 Development Library (Conferences and Seminars, Tech*Ed,
 March 1995).
