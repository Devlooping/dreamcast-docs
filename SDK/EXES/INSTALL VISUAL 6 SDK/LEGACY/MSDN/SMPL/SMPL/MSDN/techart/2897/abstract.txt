 This Win32-based application, built with Visual C++(TM)
 (32-bit) on Windows NT(TM) version 3.5 (beta), accompanies
 the technical article “Recording and Playing Waveform
 Audio.”
 
 The SpelEdit sample demonstrates sound recording and
 allows you to construct a spelling list that consists of a
 number of words and their pronunciations. The spelling
 list can be used by the Speller application.
