SQLDEMO: Uses SQL Distributed Management Objects as an 
OLE Automation Server
The SQLDEMO sample application demonstrates the use of SQL Distributed Management Objects (SQL-
DMOs) as an OLE Automation server. This sample uses Microsoft(R) Visual Basic(R) version 4.0 as the 
OLE Automation controller. Developers can use this sample to gain a better understanding of how to 
implement OLE Automation with SQL Distributed Management Objects.
SQLDEMO is a companion sample for the "Using Microsoft OLE Automation Servers to Develop 
Solutions" technical article in the Microsoft Development Library.
Note that you must have Microsoft SQL Server version 6.0 or Microsoft SQL Workstation and their 
associated type libraries fully installed on your system to run this sample.
The SQLDEMO sample was built with the Enterprise Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic version 4.0 and 
tested on Microsoft Windows(R) 95.
