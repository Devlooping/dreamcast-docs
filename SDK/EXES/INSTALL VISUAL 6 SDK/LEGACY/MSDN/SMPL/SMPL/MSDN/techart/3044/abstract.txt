 The CTLREG sample application registers and unregisters
 OLE Controls. To register a control, choose the Register
 command from the Controls menu. This command brings up a
 dialog box that shows all of the files in the current
 directory that have the .OCX extension. You can also
 choose to view files with a .DLL extension.
 
 To unregister a control, choose the Unregister command
 from the Controls menu. This command displays an owner-
 drawn list box with a list of the currently installed
 controls and their toolbox bitmaps. It is possible to
 delete an OLE Control's .OCX file without removing its
 corresponding registry information. The "Exist" keyword in
 the dialog box identifies controls whose .OCX files exist.
 Controls that can be inserted in a standard OLE container
 are marked with the word "Insert." The 16-bit version of
 CTLREG displays 16-bit controls only, and the 32-bit
 version of CTLREG (CTLREG32) displays 32-bit controls
 only.
 
 You can delete an OLE control without unregistering it.
 Therefore, the registry may contain entries for OLE
 Controls that no longer exist on the system. CTLREG
 includes some minimal support for cleaning up entries
 associated with non-existing controls. Clicking the
 Cleanup button removes registry entries for controls whose
 .OCX files have been deleted.
 
 Use CTLREG.MAK to build the 16-bit version of CTLREG under
 Microsoft(R) Visual C++(TM) version 1.51. Use CTLREG32.MAK
 with Visual C++ version 2.0 to build the 32-bit version of
 CTLREG for Windows NT(TM) version 3.5.
 
 CTLREG is a companion sample for the "OLE Controls:
 Registration" technical article in the Microsoft
 Development Library.
 
 CTLREG was tested under Microsoft Windows(R) version 3.11
 and Windows NT version 3.5.
