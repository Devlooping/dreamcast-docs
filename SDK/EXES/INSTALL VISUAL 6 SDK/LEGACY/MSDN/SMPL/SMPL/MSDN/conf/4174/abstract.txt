 Techniques
 
 AC208.MDB augments the "Using Microsoft Access Forms Like
 the Masters" technical presentation given by Scott Barker
 at the Tech*Ed Conference held March 27-31, 1995, in New
 Orleans, Louisiana.
 
 This sample application contains several database objects
 that are based on the same tables as NWIND.MDB (the
 Northwind sample database that shipped with Microsoft(R)
 Access[R]).
 
 AC208.MDB contains a series of sample combo boxes. The
 Combo1 and Combo 2 forms contain a combo box that displays
 supplier names in a list, but stores supplier numbers. In
 the Combo 3 form, the AutoLookup feature is used to
 display related data in a combo box. The Combo 4 form
 illustrates the Dlookup function. The last combo box
 example, Combo 5, demonstrates a linked subform displaying
 data associated with a record identified by a combo
 selection.
 
 AC208.MDB also contains examples on how to use subforms.
 In Subform 1, a subform contains data, while the main form
 contains the subform aggregate information. Subform 2
 illustrates a one-to-many form.
 
 Examples for the following techniques can also be found in
 AC208.MDB: Creating a dialog box, finding a record based
 on a combo box selection, adding a new record when it's
 not in a list, and setting a control's record source
 during run time.
 
 AC208.MDB requires Microsoft Access version 2.0 to run.
