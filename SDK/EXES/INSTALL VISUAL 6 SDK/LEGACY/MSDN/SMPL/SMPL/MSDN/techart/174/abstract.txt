 VLIST: Demonstrates a Virtual List Box
 
 VLIST implements a single-selection, single-column virtual
 list box capable of displaying millions of items. The
 standard list box control in Microsoft(R) Windows(TM) can
 contain a limited number of items. VLIST shows how to
 implement list boxes that exceed this limitation.
 
 VLIST is a companion sample for the "A Virtual List Box
 Implementation with VLIST" technical article on the
 Microsoft Developer Network CD. For a working example of
 VLIST, see the Microsoft Developer Network CD--the topic
 listing in the Index window was implemented with VLIST.
 
 VLIST was built and tested under Microsoft Windows version
 3.1.
