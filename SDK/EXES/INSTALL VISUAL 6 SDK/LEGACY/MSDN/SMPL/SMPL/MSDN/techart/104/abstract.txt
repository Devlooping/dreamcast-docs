BACK: Demonstrates Building a Large-Model Application with
a DLL

Revised: March 1, 1993

BACK is a companion application for "The C/C++ Compiler
Learns New Tricks" technical article on the Microsoft(R)
Developer Network CD. BACK lists command-line options and
environment variables. The program can be built for MS-
DOS(R) or for Windows(TM). The MKDOS.BAT batch file builds
the MS-DOS version, and MKWIN.BAT builds the Windows
version. The Windows version of BACK sends output to the
debug monitor.

BACK calls the TRACE.DLL. The program demonstrates the
following new programming practices for building protected-
mode Windows version 3.1 applications with Microsoft C/C++
version 7.0:

>  Using main instead of WinMain.

>  Using large model.

>  Using malloc (_fmalloc).

>  Using the run-time version of LibMain.

>  Using the run-time version of WEP.

>  Using a simpler make file.

>  Compiling and linking from the command line.
 
BACK was built and tested under Microsoft Windows 3.1.
