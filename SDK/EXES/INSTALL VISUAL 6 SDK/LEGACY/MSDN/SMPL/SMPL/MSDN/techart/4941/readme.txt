The ODBC Registry Wizard kit.

Basic Overview
=======================================================================

The ODBC Registry Wizard kit contains the following three
files...


1) odbcreg.mda
---------------
   This is a Microsoft Access 7.0 database that demonstrates how to 
   implement a ODBC Registry Wizard.

2) odbcreg.mdt
-------------------------------------
   A sample setup template to use with the Microsoft Access 95
   Developers Toolkit's (ADT) "Setup Wizard" application.  This file
   contains all of the options needed to install the wizard using
   the ADT.

3) zipsetup.exe
-------------------------------------
   A zip file that will install the wizard components on a machine
   that has the retail version of Microsoft Access and the Microsoft 
   Access 95 Developers Toolkit.  You must unzip the file in the same
   directory where funcwiz.mda is located for the setup to
   work correctly

5) readme.txt
