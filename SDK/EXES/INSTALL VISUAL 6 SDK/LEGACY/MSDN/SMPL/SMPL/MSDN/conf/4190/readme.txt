Here are the sample files from my session. I hope you can make use
of them! Please examine the source code of both the DOCVCX.PRG  
and FOXTABLE.PRG programs before running them - they have
"hard coded" variables that you may need to change. 

Please feel free to call me or send me some E-Mail if you have
any questions!
