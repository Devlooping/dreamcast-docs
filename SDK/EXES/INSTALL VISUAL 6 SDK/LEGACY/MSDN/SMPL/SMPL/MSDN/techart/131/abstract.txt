ZUSAMMEN: Illustrates the Use of the Microsoft(R) C
Compiler Options with Microsoft Windows(TM)

Zusammen, which means "together" in German, scrolls two
different windows simultaneously. To scroll, the user
selects the windows with the mouse and clicks Zusammen's
scroll bars. This makes it easy to compare data in two
different windows or applications.

Zusammen consists of a program generated by MAKEAPP (see
the MAKEAPP abstract) and a dynamic link library (DLL)
called Picker that selects the windows to be scrolled.

For more information on ZUSAMMEN, see the "Microsoft(R)
Windows(TM) and the C Compiler Options" technical article.

ZUSAMMEN was built and tested under Microsoft Windows
version 3.1.
