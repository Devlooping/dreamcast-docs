 EasyCI is a version of the EasyGL sample application that
 demonstrates how to use color index mode in OpenGL(TM).
 EasyCI uses GLlib.DLL, which contains a class library for
 OpenGL. Like EasyGL, EasyCI puts a cube, a pyramid, and a
 dodecahedron on the screen. The only difference is that
 EasyCI uses color index mode instead of RGBA
 (red/green/blue/alpha) mode.
 
 EasyCl is discussed in the "OpenGL IV: Color Index Mode"
 technical article in the Microsoft(R) Development Library.
 EasyGL is discussed in the "OpenGL III: Building an OpenGL
 C++ Class" technical article in the Development Library.
 
 EasyCI was built with Microsoft Visual C++(TM) version 2.0
 and the Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) version
 3.0, and tested under Microsoft Windows NT(TM) version
 3.5, on the Intel(R), MIPS(R), and Alpha AXP(TM)
 platforms.
