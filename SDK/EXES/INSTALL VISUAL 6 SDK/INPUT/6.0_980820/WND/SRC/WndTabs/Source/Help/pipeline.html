<h1>Privacy Information</h1>

<p>Some features of WndTabs send information over the Internet.
&quot;Others appear to send information (though they don't). &quot;
This section describes these features.

</p>

<h2>Automatic Trial Code Download</h2>
<p>The automatic trial code download feature connects to the key generator on
the WndTabs web site.&nbsp; Like the version checking feature, this is done
through HTTP, and both the version of WndTabs and OS are passed.</p>
<p>In order to prevent malicious use of this feature, WndTabs sends various
parameters about your machine.&nbsp; Though I won't go into the specifics of
what is sent, I will mention what is <i><u>not</u> </i>sent:</p>
<ol>
  <li>No user names, e-mails or other identifications are sent.</li>
  <li>Nothing of an inventory nature is sent (e.g., the directory listing of
    your hard disk).</li>
</ol>
<p>Some examples of things that might be sent are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The amount of RAM on your machine.</li>
  <li>The size or your hard disk.</li>
  <li>The number of hard disks on your machine.</li>
  <li>etc...</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, the information transferred is not linked back to you, nor can it be
used to track you or say anything about you.&nbsp; It is only used to identify
the <i>machine</i> you are using.</p>


<h2>
WndTabs Extension Module Initialization</h2>
<p>WndTabs performs one other network based activity.&nbsp; This involves
checking the local network for other running copies of WndTabs, in order to
enforce the <a href="license.html">license agreement</a>.&nbsp; In the capacity,
WndTabs installs a listening port and sends a broadcast to the LAN.&nbsp; The
broadcast is performed using socket LAN broadcast mechanism, which does not exit
the local area network.&nbsp; To learn more, search for &quot;<u>2.2.4 broadcasting</u>&quot;
in your MSDN.</p>
