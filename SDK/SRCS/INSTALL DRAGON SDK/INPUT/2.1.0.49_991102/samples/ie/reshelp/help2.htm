  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Your attack scope is divided 
    into the fifteen by sixteen grid of the ocean that the cloaked enemy fleet 
    is known to inhabit. Shooting into a square on the grid destroys whatever 
    part of a ship is in that square. Hit the ship in each square it inhabits 
    and it sinks. Budgets are tight and you are limited to 25 shots. But the Admiral 
    will allocate you two more shots every time you hit an enemy ship. Run out 
    of shots before the fleet is sunk and the game is over.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Position your sights over 
    a square of ocean with the Directional Arrows or joystick. Press the "A" button 
    and a shot is fired into that square. Hitting a ship results in an explosion 
    and the Game Message area (bottom left) confirms the "Hit!". Sinking a ship 
    is also confirmed ("You sank my Battleship!"). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Misses result in the ocean 
    in that square turning darker blue and the Game Message area reports a "Miss!".</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Keep track of the amount 
    of shots you have left in the Game Statistics area (bottom right). The statistics 
    show you the number of shots you have left (S:20); the number of hits (H:5); 
    the number of missed shots (M:5); and the number of ships sunk — kills — (K:1). 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sinking all ten ships 
    before you run out of shots wins the game! If you run out of shots before 
    you sink all ten ships you lose — just give it another try. To quit the game, 
    press the "X" button. </font></p>
