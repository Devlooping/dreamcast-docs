1. Description of the SDK
-------------------------
The WndTabs SDK allows any DevStudio add-in to extend WndTabs in two ways:
o Add new commands to the WndTabs menus
o Control the tab contents (text, colors, icons)

See the docs/ directory for more detail about the SDK.
See http://www.wndtabs.com for more information about WndTabs.

I cannot even begin to thank Jerzy "Bugslayer" Kaczorowski enough!  From 
nagging me to write the SDK right down to implementing the first non-
trivial addon, Jerzy was an asset every step of the way.
