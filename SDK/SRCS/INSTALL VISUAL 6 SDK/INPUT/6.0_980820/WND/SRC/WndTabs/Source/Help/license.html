<h1>License Agreement</h1>

<p>You should carefully read the following terms and conditions before using 
Window Tabs. If you do not accept these terms you must cease using this software
immediately.
</p><br>

<h2>Copyright</h2>

<p>The Window Tabs Add-In (WndTabs) is copyright © 1997-2004 by Oz Solomonovich.</p>

<p>The Window Tabs Extension Module
(the &quot;<u>Extension Module</u>&quot;) is copyright © 1999-2004
by Oz Solomonovich.
</p>

<p>The WndTabs SDK Sample Add-In is copyright © 2000-2001 by Oz Solomonovich.
</p>Other portions of this package, including - but not limited to - the Add-In Communication Library (AddInComm)
are

<h2>Registration</h2>

<p><b>WndTabs and the WndTabs SDK Sample</b> (the &quot;<u>package</u>&quot;) and
their source code are provided free of charge (freeware). </p>

<p>The <b>Extension Module</b> is not free software. Paying the registration 
fees buys you one registration code and the right to use the Extension Module as 
specified below.</p>

<p>Your Extension Module registration code entitles you to use the Extension 
Module on one workstation at any given time.  You can think of the registration 
code as the right to read a book: A book cannot be read at two different 
locations at the same time.  As such, you may install the Extension Module and 
use your registration code on as many workstations you like, as long as no more 
than one workstation is in use at any given time. </p>
<br>

<h2>Distribution</h2>

<p>Provided that you do not include your Registration Code 
(which was provided upon payment) you are hereby licensed to make
copies of both the Add-In and the Extension
Module; give exact copies of the original to anyone; and
distribute the Add-In and Extension Module in
their unmodified form via electronic
means. You are specifically prohibited from charging for any such
copies.
