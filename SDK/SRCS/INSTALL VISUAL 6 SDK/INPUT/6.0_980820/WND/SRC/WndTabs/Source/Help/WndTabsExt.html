<h1>The WndTabs Extension Module (WndTabsExt)</h1>

<h2>Freeware and Shareware In One Package</h2>

<p>WndTabs started out as a cross between what I though was a much
needed addition to DevStudio, and a sample for MFC/Win32/Add-In
programming. Both WndTabs and it's source were released to the
public - for free. </p>

<p>WndTabs is a large, fast evolving project. I spend an enormous
amount of time answering your e-mails, and fixing/updating the
code to your requests. Unfortunately, keeping WndTabs a high-standard
add-in is costing me more time and money than I can afford. In order to offset
the financial and personal costs, I introduced the WndTabs Extension Module
(WndTabsExt) in version 2.50.&nbsp; WndTabsExt is a shareware module which adds
many advanced functions to WndTabs. (Registration information is <a href="reg.html">here</a>). </p>

<h2>Advanced Functionality - Overview</h2>
<p>Registered users of WndTabsExt have access to many advanced features not
available in the freeware version.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
    <li>The <i>Advanced Tab Control</i> with Tab Grouping and coloring</li>
    <li>Full UI (menus + keyboard) customizations</li>
    <li>Access to full range of WndTabs commands</li>
    <li>Enhanced functionality for addons: tab customizations</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout the WndTabs online documentation, the<img border="0" src="WndTabsExt.gif" align="absmiddle" width="79" height="23">icon
is used to identify WndTabsExt specific features.&nbsp; These features are not
available to non registered users.</p>
<h2>
The Advanced Tab Control</h2>
<p>The advanced control was designed with two purposes in mind:</p>
<ol>
  <li>To save screen real-estate.</li>
  <li>To help make tabs and file more manageable.</li>
</ol>
<p>These goals are achieved through two primary features:</p>
<ol>
  <li><i>Grouping</i>: The advanced tab control is capable of grouping multiple
    files on a single tab using a proprietary mini-toolbar.&nbsp; This allows
    more tabs to fit on the screen, and also allows you to control the entire
    group of files with a single command.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    </center></li>
  <li><i>Coloring</i>: The advance tab control allows you to choose different
    colors for selected and non selected tabs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li><i>Quick Close (&quot;X&quot;) Button</i>: Lets you close the tab with a
    single click or multiple tabs by right-clicking.</li>
  <li><i>Custom Transformations</i>: WndTabs Addons can modify the tabs in many ways.&nbsp; For instance, in the above image, icons read only files
    were given a red background by the WndTabs SDK sample addon.&nbsp; You can
    write your own addons using the <a href="http://www.wndtabs.com/wt/sdk/">WndTabs
    SDK</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
Full UI Customizations</h2>
<p>WndTabsExt users have full control over the WndTabs UI.&nbsp; This includes <a href="CustomizeCommands.html">customizations
of toolbars and menus</a> as well as full <a href="CustomizeKeyboard.html">customizations
of keyboard shortcuts</a>.&nbsp; Using these versatile features, you can craft a
version of WndTabs that exactly suited to your needs.</p>
<h2>
Other Goodies</h2>
<p>WndTabsExt offers some other smaller features which are sprinkled
throughout the program.&nbsp; These features are clearly marked in the WndTabs option dialogs.</p>
