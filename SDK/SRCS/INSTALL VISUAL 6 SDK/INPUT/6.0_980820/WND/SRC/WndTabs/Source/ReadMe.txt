  IMPORTANT: You will need to have the original Wndtabs 3.0x MSI installation 
  file handy for this to succeed.  If you are having problems upgrading, 
  please refer to the online FAQ.

  4.2 Upgrading from v2.50
  ------------------------
  The WndTabs 3.20 installer will automatically uninstall your v2.50 
  installation as it installs version 3.20.

  4.3 Upgrading from older versions
  ---------------------------------
  Versions of WndTabs earlier than v2.50 are not supported by the v3.20 
  installer.  If you are currently running an earlier version of WndTabs,
  you should remove it manually before starting the installation.
