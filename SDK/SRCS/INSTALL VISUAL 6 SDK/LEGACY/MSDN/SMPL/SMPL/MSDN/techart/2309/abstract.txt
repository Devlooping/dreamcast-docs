 The UpDown sample application implements a spin box using
 an up-down control and an edit control. The up-down
 control is a new common control in Chicago, which is the
 code name for the next version of the Microsoft(R)
 Windows(TM) operating system.
 
 An up-down control is a small window that contains up and
 down arrows that the user can click to increment or
 decrement a value. You can use an up-down control alone as
 a simplified scroll bar, or with another control. In the
 UpDown sample application, the up-down control is paired
 with an edit control to create a spin box. When the user
 clicks an arrow or uses the arrow keys on the keyboard,
 the up-down control increments or decrements the value in
 the edit control.
 
 UpDown implements the spin box in a dialog box. When the
 user chooses OK from the dialog box, the current selection
 in the spin box is retrieved and the dialog box is
 dismissed.
 
 UpDown is a companion sample for the "Win32 Common
 Controls, Part 3: Trackbars, Progress Bars, and Up-Down
 Controls" technical article in the Microsoft Development
 Library.
 
 UpDown was built and tested under Chicago; however, the
 common control dynamic-link library (COMCTL32.DLL) that is
 included with Chicago will also be supported under
 Win32s(TM) running on Windows 3.1 and Windows NT(TM) via
 redistributable DLLs (just as the common dialogs were
 provided for Windows 3.0). It is important to note that
 these new common controls are 32-bit only and will not be
 supported for 16-bit Windows environments.
 
 WARNING: The UpDown executable file was built and tested
 using the Chicago Preliminary Development Kit. The
 executable will run only on Chicago; it will not run under
 Windows 3.1 or Windows NT. If you have Chicago installed
 on your machine, but you have problems running this
 sample, copy the project files to your system using the
 button below, rebuild the project, and run the executable.
