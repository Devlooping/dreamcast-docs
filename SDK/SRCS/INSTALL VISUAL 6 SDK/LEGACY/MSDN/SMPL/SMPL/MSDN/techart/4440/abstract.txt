DAODEMO: Uses the Data Access Object as an OLE Automation 
Server
The DAODEMO sample application demonstrates the use of the Data Access Object (DAO) version 3.0 as 
an OLE Automation server. This sample uses Microsoft(R) Visual Basic(R) version 4.0 as the controller. 
Developers can use this sample to gain a better understanding of how to implement OLE Automation with 
the Data Access Object.
DAODEMO is a companion sample for the "Using Microsoft OLE Automation Servers to Develop 
Solutions" technical article in the Microsoft Development Library.
Note that you must have the Data Access Object and its associated type libraries fully installed on your 
system to run this sample.
The DAODEMO sample was built with the Enterprise Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic version 4.0 and 
tested on Microsoft Windows(R) 95.
