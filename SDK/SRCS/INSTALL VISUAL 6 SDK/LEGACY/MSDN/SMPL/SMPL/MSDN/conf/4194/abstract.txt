 ML302.MDB augments the "Mail-Enabling Your Microsoft
 Access-Based Application" technical presentation given by
 Stephen Wynkoop at the Tech*Ed Conference held March 27-
 31, 1995, in New Orleans, Louisiana.
 
 From within Microsoft(R) Access(R), there are many
 different things that you can accomplish by implementing
 your system in a manner that recognizes and uses
 electronic mail. The Microsoft messaging application
 programming interface (MAPI) mail transport layer can
 provide the answer to moving information around the
 network.
 
 For more information, please refer to the technical
 presentation, which is also available in the Microsoft
 Development Library (Conferences and Seminars, Tech*Ed,
 March 1995).
 
 ML302.MDB requires Mirosoft Access version 2.0 to run.
