 Written in C++
 
 This sample application illustrates Microsoft(R) Windows
 NT(TM) kernel-mode device drivers ported to C++.
 
 The sample contains two project files that you can load
 and run using Microsoft Visual C++(TM) version 2.0. The
 resulting executables are Windows NT kernel-mode device
 drivers that you can use to replace the Windows NT
 keyboard and mouse class drivers.
 
 This sample accompanies two technical articles -- "The
 Windows NT Kernel-Mode Driver Cookbook, Featuring Visual
 C++" and "Writing Windows NT Kernel-Mode Drivers in C++" -
 - in the Microsoft Development Library.
 
 The sample was built with Microsoft Visual C++ version
 2.0, and tested under Windows NT version 3.5.
