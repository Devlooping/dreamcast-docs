 VBDSS augments the "A Turnkey Client-Server Decision
 Support Architecture" technical presentation given by
 Craig Goren at the Tech*Ed Conference held March 27-31,
 1995, in New Orleans, Louisiana.
 
 This sample application is a multiple-document interface
 (MDI) Microsoft(R) Visual Basic(R) and SQL Server project
 template that demonstrates a decision support system
 (DSS). It provides a sample shell that illustrates the
 presentation concepts. The technical presentation, which
 is also available in the Microsoft Development Library
 (Conferences and Seminars, Tech*Ed, March 1995), contains
 more detailed information on the sample and required
 files.
 
 VBDSS requires and incorporates the Microsoft Visual Basic
 programming system, Microsoft SQL Server client-server
 database management system, Microsoft Windows NT(TM), and
 Microsoft Office suite.
