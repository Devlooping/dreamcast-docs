 Chicago
 
 The Progress sample application implements a simple
 progress indicator control in Chicago, which is the code
 name for the next version of the Microsoft(R) Windows(TM)
 operating system. The progress bar has a range of zero to
 20, and it increments by one. A timer sends messages to
 increment (step) the progress.
 
 Progress is a companion sample for the "Win32 Common
 Controls, Part 3: Trackbars, Progress Bars, and Up-Down
 Controls" technical article in the Microsoft Development
 Library.
 
 Progress was built and tested under Chicago; however, the
 common control dynamic-link library (COMCTL32.DLL) that is
 included with Chicago will also be supported under
 Win32s(TM) running on Windows 3.1 and Windows NT(TM) via
 redistributable DLLs (just as the common dialogs were
 provided for Windows 3.0). It is important to note that
 these new common controls are 32-bit only and will not be
 supported for 16-bit Windows environments.
 
 WARNING: The Progress executable file was built and tested
 using the Chicago Preliminary Development Kit. The
 executable will run only on Chicago; it will not run under
 Windows 3.1 or Windows NT. If you have Chicago installed
 on your machine, but you have problems running this
 sample, copy the project files to your system using the
 button below, rebuild the project, and run the executable.
