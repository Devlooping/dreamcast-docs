 FROGFLY: Simulates an Ecosystem with Life Objects
 
 FROGFLY is a Microsoft(R) Windows NT(TM) application that
 implements a small ecosystem. It is intended to
 demonstrate the simulation of life objects by combining
 C++ code with multithreading.
 
 FROGFLY uses process threads with critical sections to
 simulate an environment in which a frog feeds on flies
 that, in turn, feed on food spills. Using the mouse, the
 user can control the number of flies and place food spills
 around the "room.". Because critical sections are used to
 synchronize access to environment variables, all of the
 life object threads must belong to the same process.
 
 The application initially displays an empty screen with a
 cheeseburger as a cursor. The user starts the simulation
 by clicking the Simulation.Start Simulation menu item. A
 frog appears and moves over the screen, controlled by the
 user via the arrow keys. The main window's title bar
 displays a constantly descending number of calories,
 indicating how much energy the frog has. When the count
 hits 0, the frog dies.
 
 The user can generate flies that move over the screen by
 selecting the Options.Add Fly menu item. When the frog
 hits a fly, the fly dies and the frog's calorie count
 increases. Flies can also die of starvation if they do not
 get food, but they will multiply automatically once they
 reach a predefined energy level.
 
 For additional information on this sample application, see
 the "Using Multithreading and C++ to Generate Life
 Objects"msdn_frogfly1 technical article on the Microsoft
 Developer Network CD or the README.TXT project file.
 
 FROGFLY is written in C++ and was built with the Windows
 NT Software Development Kit (SDK).
