 Paste, and Transparent Bitmaps
 
 This sample accompanies the "MFC Tips for Copying,
 Pasting, Blting, and Creating Owner-Drawn List Boxes"
 technical article in the Microsoft(R) Development Library
 and shows how an owner-drawn list box can be constructed
 using MFC classes. The list box items each show a small,
 irregularly shaped bitmap at the left end of the line. The
 bitmaps are implemented with a C++ class that makes
 drawing them with a transparency mask trivial. Data from
 the listbox can be copied to and pasted from the
 Clipboard, using a technique that can be easily adapted
 for use with other MFC classes.
 
 The sample code in MFCCLIP was written using the Microsoft
 Foundation Class Library for Windows NT on Windows NT
 version 3.5 pre-release. It was tested on Microsoft
 Windows(TM) version 3.1 under the Win32s(TM) extensions.
