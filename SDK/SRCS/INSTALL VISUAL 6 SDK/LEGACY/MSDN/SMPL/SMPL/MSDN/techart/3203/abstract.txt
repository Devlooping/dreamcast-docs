 EasyGL is a version of the GLEasy sample application that
 uses the GLlib dynamic-link library (DLL). GLlib contains
 a class library for implementing OpenGL(TM). Like GLEasy,
 EasyGL puts a cube, a pyramid, and a dodecahedron on the
 screen. If you are just starting to work with OpenGL, take
 a look at the GLEasy sample application in the
 Microsoft(R) Development Library.
 
 For more information on EasyGL, refer to the "OpenGL III:
 Building an OpenGL C++ Class" technical article in the
 Development Library.
 
 EasyGL uses GLlib.DLL.To run EasyGL, you must copy GLlib(-
 d).DLL to your system and place it in your system path. To
 compile EasyGL, you need GLlib(-d).LIB and the header
 files from GLlib.DLL. Use Microsoft Visual C++(TM) (open
 the Tools menu and choose Options) to set up the INCLUDE
 and LIBRARY directories to search for GLlib files.
 
 EasyGL was built with Microsoft Visual C++ version 2.0 and
 the Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) version 3.0,
 and tested under Microsoft Windows NT(TM) version 3.5, on
 the Intel(R), MIPS(R), and Alpha AXP(TM) platforms.
