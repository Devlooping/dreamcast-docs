 VECTOR2D: Basic Vector Operations in Windows NT
 
 VECTOR2D is a Win32(R) dynamic-link library (DLL) that
 provides basic vector functionality and operations for the
 Microsoft(R) Windows NT(TM) environment. Vectors allow you
 to do complex things using simple concepts. Through vector
 use, many geometric concepts can be expressed
 algebraically with little consideration of the coordinate
 system. With a vector library, solutions to various
 graphics problems are reduced to creative use of the
 functions in your application.
 
 VECTOR2D includes all of the functions described in the
 "Use of Two-Dimensional Vectors with Windows
 NT"msdn_vector technical article, written by Dennis Crain,
 in the Microsoft Development Library. You may use the DLL
 as is or add functions to it. View VECTOR2D as a first
 step to building a significant library of graphics tools
 that will allow you to write fully featured two-
 dimensional graphics applications.
 
 VECTOR2D requires the Microsoft Windows NT operating
 system to run.
