 The NATIVEVB sample code was used to generate
 NATIVEVB.DLL, by using the Microsoft(R) Visual C++(TM)
 version 1.51 project file, NATIVEVB.MAK. NATIVEVB.DLL is a
 dynamic-link library (DLL) constructed according to the
 method described in "Creating Useful Native Visual Basic
 and Microsoft Access Functions." Full documentation on the
 functions is available in "A Collection of Useful Native
 Visual Basic and Microsoft Access Functions." (Both
 articles are in the Microsoft Development Library.) The
 Visual Basic(R) projects PERF0.MAK, PERF1.MAK, and
 LOAD_CTL.MAK, included in the NATIVEVB sample, are
 explained in the first article mentioned above.
