The Sample Text Import Wizard kit.

Basic Overview
=======================================================================

The Sample Text Import Wizard kit contains the following four 
files...


1) textwiz.mda
---------------
   This is a Microsoft Access 7.0 database that demonstrates how to 
   implement a Sample Text Import Wizard.

2) textwiz.mdt
-------------------------------------
   A sample setup template to use with the Microsoft Access 95
   Developers Toolkit's (ADT) "Setup Wizard" application.  This file
   contains all of the options needed to install the wizard using
   the ADT.

3) sales.dat
-------------------------
   A sample text file to test with the textwiz.mda database.
   This is the sample file that is analyzed for text import in the
   textwiz.doc

4) zipsetup.exe
-------------------------------------
   A zip file that will install the wizard components on a machine
   that has the retail version of Microsoft Access and the Microsoft 
   Access 95 Developers Toolkit.  You must unzip the file in the same
   directory where textwiz.mda, sales.dat are textwiz.doc located for 
   the setup to work correctly
