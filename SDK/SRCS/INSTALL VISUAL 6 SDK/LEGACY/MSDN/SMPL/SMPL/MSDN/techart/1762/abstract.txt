 W32PEN: Experiments with Cosmetic and Geometric Pens
 
 W32PEN is a Microsoft(R) Win32(R) application that lets
 the user experiment with cosmetic and geometric pens. The
 style, end cap, miter, color, and width of the pens may be
 manipulated also. Given a pen, the application draws a
 polyline that consists of 10 randomly generated points
 within a clipping region. Multiple pens and lines can be
 drawn. Information about each pen and line is stored in a
 structure that acts as a node in a doubly linked list. The
 list is traversed in response to paint messages. The
 application also demonstrates the use of enhanced
 metafiles, clipping regions, hit-testing within a region,
 and use of custom cursors over a region.
 
 W32PEN accompanies the "Pens in Win32"msdn_w32pens
 technical article on the Microsoft Development Library.
 
 W32PEN was built using Microsoft Visual C++(TM) version
 1.0 and was tested under Microsoft Windows NT(TM) version
 3.1.
