SCHPEXT: Accesses Samples That Use OLE Automation with 
Schedule+ 
The three sample applications in the SCHPEXT project demonstrate the use of Microsoft(R) Schedule+ as 
an OLE Automation server using Microsoft Visual Basic(R) version 4.0 as the controller. Developers can 
use these samples to gain a better understanding of how to implement OLE Automation using Schedule+.
SPLFORM, SPMFORM, and SAUFORM are companion samples for the technical article titled An 
Extended Introduction to Schedule+ OLE Automation Programming in the Microsoft Development Library 
and illustrate one of the programming models for Schedule+.
Note that you must have the Microsoft Exchange beta 2 (or later) version of Schedule+ to be fully installed 
on your system to run these sample applications. Note also that these samples will work with earlier 
versions of Schedule+ if all of the declarations that reference Schedule+ objects are changed to "As Object" 
instead of, respectively, "As Application," "As Table," "As Item," "As Property," or "As Schedule." 
This sample suite was built with the Enterprise Edition of Visual Basic 4.0 and tested on Microsoft 
Windows(R) 95.
