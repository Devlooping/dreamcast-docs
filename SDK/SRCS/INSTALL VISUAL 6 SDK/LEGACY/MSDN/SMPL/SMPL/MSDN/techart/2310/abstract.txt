 The Slider sample application implements three simple
 trackbar controls in Chicago, which is the code name for
 the next version of the Microsoft(R) Windows(TM) operating
 system:
 
 >  Trackbar with default styles.
 
 >  Trackbar with tick marks on the top and a selection
 set.
 
 >  Vertical trackbar with the ticks on the left.
 
 The status bar at the bottom of the screen indicates the
 current notification being sent to the trackbar that has
 the keyboard focus.
 
 Slider is a companion sample for the "Win32 Common
 Controls, Part 3: Trackbars, Progress Bars, and Up-Down
 Controls" technical article in the Microsoft Development
 Library.
 
 Slider was built and tested under Chicago; however, the
 common control dynamic-link library (COMCTL32.DLL) that is
 included with Chicago will also be supported under
 Win32s(TM) running on Windows 3.1 and Windows NT(TM) via
 redistributable DLLs (just as the common dialogs were
 provided for Windows 3.0). It is important to note that
 these new common controls are 32-bit only and will not be
 supported for 16-bit Windows environments.
 
 WARNING: The Slider executable file was built and tested
 using the Chicago Preliminary Development Kit. The
 executable will run only on Chicago; it will not run under
 Windows 3.1 or Windows NT. If you have Chicago installed
 on your machine, but you have problems running this
 sample, copy the project files to your system using the
 button below, rebuild the project, and run the executable.
