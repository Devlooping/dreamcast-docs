 STYLES32: Demonstrates How Style Bits Affect a Window
 
 The STYLES32 sample application creates a window using
 user-selected dialog box options. STYLES32 illustrates how
 an application can use Microsoft(R) Windows(TM) functions
 to navigate the window structure and to control the style
 and appearance of a window on the desktop. For more
 information, see the "Win32 Window Hierarchy and
 Styles"msdn_styles32 technical article on the Microsoft
 Development Library.
 
 STYLES32 was built and tested under Microsoft Windows
 NT(TM) version 3.1.
