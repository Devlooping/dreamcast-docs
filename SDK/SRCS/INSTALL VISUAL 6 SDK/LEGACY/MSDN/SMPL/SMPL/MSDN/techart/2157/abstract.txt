 DLDETECT: MFC-Based Tool to Aid Multithreaded Application
 Design
 
 DLDETECT is a Win32(R) sample application that helps
 programmers of multithreaded applications detect and
 eliminate deadlocks in their applications. DLDETECT
 accompanies the "Detecting Deadlocks in Multithreaded
 Win32-based Applications,"msdn_deadlock "The
 Implementation of DLDETECT.EXE,"msdn_dldetect and "Putting
 DLDETECT to Work"msdn_dldwork technical articles in the
 Microsoft(R) Development Library.
 
 The application consists of two separate projects:
 
 > A project for MATRIX.DLL, which is a module needed by
 DLDETECT
 
 > A project for DLDETECT itself
 
 As a sample application, DLDETECT demonstrates Microsoft
 Foundation Class Library (MFC) applications with multiple
 views as well as self-rendering editable objects.
 
 DLDETECT was built using Microsoft Visual C++(TM) 32-bit
 Edition version 1.0 (MFC 2.0) and tested under Microsoft
 Windows NT(TM) version 3.1.
