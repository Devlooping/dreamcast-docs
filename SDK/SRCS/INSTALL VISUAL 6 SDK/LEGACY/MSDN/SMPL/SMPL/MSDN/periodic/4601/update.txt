I'd also like to supply a brief update to a question in my September 1995 column in which Gary Tessler 
wrote asking how to enumerate the docs in his MFC app. I showed how to write a class, CDocEnumerator 
that does this. As soon as I wrote my code, wouldn't you know MFC 4.0 has a totally new way of tracking 
documents. Many of you no doubt discovered this your own. Instead of storing a list of document templates, 
CWinApp now uses something called a CDocManager.  CWinApp::m_pTemplateList no longer exists, so 
the original CDocEnumerator in my September column doesn't even compile. (Thanks to Reinhold Gerharz 
of Tracor Applied Sciences, Inc. for calling this to my attention.) The latest version of the ENUMDOC 
sample on the MSJ bulletin board contains the fix, the short of which is that instead of writing

CDocTemplate *pDT;
POSITION pos;
pos = pApp->m_templateList.GetHeadPosition();
.
.
pDT = pApp->(CDocTemplate*)m_templateList.GetNext(pos);

you should now write

pos = pApp->m_pDocManager->GetFirstDocTemplatePosition();
.
.
pDT = m_pDocManager->GetNextDocTemplate(pos);

CDocManager manages a list of document templates; it's essentially what CWinApp::m_templateList used 
to be, only now it's a special class instead of a raw CPtrList, and consolidates many doc-related operations.
