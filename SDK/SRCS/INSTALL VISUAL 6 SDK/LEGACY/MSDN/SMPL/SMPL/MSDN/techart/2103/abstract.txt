 W32HIT: Hit Testing Lines and Curves in Win32
 
 W32HIT is a Microsoft(R) Win32(R) sample application that
 demonstrates techniques for hit testing lines and curves.
 The sample is a modification of the W32PEN sample. Hit
 testing of lines uses vectors to determine the distance of
 a mouse click from the line. Two methods illustrate hit
 testing of Bézier curves. The first method uses code from
 the public domain to regenerate the points of the curve.
 The distance from the mouse click to the nearest point on
 the curve is used to determine if the curve has been hit.
 The second method uses the path functions of Win32. The
 curve is flattened into line segments. The line hit-
 testing code is then used to determine if the curve has
 been hit.
 
 The application also demonstrates the use of enhanced
 metafiles, clipping regions, hit testing within a region,
 and use of custom cursors over a region.
 
 W32HIT accompanies the "Win32: Hit Testing Lines and
 Curves"msdn_hittest2 technical article in the Microsoft
 Development Library. W32HIT was built using Microsoft
 Visual C++(TM) version 1.0 and tested under Microsoft
 Windows NT(TM) version 3.1.
