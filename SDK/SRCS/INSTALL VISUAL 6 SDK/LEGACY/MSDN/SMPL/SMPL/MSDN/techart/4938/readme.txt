   This is a Microsoft Access 7.0 database that demonstrates how to 
   implement a Domain Function Builder Wizard.

2) dmainwiz.mdt

   A sample setup template to use with the Microsoft Access 95
   Developers Toolkit's (ADT) "Setup Wizard" application.  This file
   contains all of the options needed to install the wizard using
   the ADT.

3) zipsetup.exe
