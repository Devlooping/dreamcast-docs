 GLpal creates a logical palette using OpenGL(TM) and the
 graphics device interface (GDI), and compares the palettes
 to see how they differ.
 
 In the GLpal window, the system palette is displayed in
 the lower-left corner, the logical palette (drawn using
 OpenGL) is displayed in the upper-right corner, and the
 logical palette (drawn using GDI) is displayed in the
 lower-right corner. To see the RGB (red/green/blue) value
 and the palette index for each color, press the left mouse
 button and drag the mouse over the colors. These values
 are displayed in the upper-left corner of the window.
 
 If you turn color tracing on from the Options menu, GLpal
 compares the RGB value for the GDI square with the RGB
 value for the OpenGL square. Colors that do not match are
 identified by a black dot in the middle of the square.
 
 GLEasy accompanies the "OpenGL II: Windows Palettes in
 RGBA Mode" technical article in the Microsoft(R)
 Development Library.
 
 GLEasy was built using Microsoft Visual C++(TM) version
 2.0, and tested under Windows NT(TM) version 3.5.
