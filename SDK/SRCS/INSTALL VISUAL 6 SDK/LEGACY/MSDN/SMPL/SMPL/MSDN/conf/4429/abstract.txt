SQL303: Demonstrates Asynchronous Data Access (Host and 
Remote)
The SQL303 sample application demonstrates how to use the Messaging Application Programming 
Interface (MAPI) or Remote Access Service (RAS) to perform asynchronous data access. Queries are 
delivered to a directory where the host engine picks them up. The host then returns the data to the remote 
client as a Microsoft(R) Access database.
SQL303 is a companion sample for the "Building Asynchronous Data Access Solutions Using MAPI" 
technical article in the Microsoft Development Library.
The SQL303 sample was tested on Microsoft SQL Server version 4.21 for Windows(R) NT(TM) version 
3.51.
