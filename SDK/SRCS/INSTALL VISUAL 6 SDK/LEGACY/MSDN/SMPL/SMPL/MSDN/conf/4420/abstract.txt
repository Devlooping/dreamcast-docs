VB207: Demonstrates Mainframe Downscaling with Microsoft 
Access
This Microsoft(R) Access database contains code that creates a copy of a mainframe database in Microsoft 
Access version 2.0, creates a set of reports and forms based on this database, and then automatically exports 
the reports and forms to Visual Basic(R) version 3.0. The VB207 database is a companion sample for the 
"Leveraging the Mainframe in Business Solutions with Microsoft Access and Visual Basic" technical article 
in the Microsoft Development Library. The code that exports forms and reports to Visual Basic 3.0 is 
incomplete, but demonstrates a methodology for building a complete wizard that exports a Microsoft 
Access application into a Visual Basic project.
