Server 
The VTXTDEMO sample application demonstrates the use of the Voice Text object as an OLE Automation 
server. This sample uses Microsoft(R) Visual Basic(R) version 4.0 as the OLE Automation controller. 
Developers can use this sample to gain a better understanding of how to implement OLE Automation with 
the Voice Text object.
VTXTDEMO is a companion sample for "Using Microsoft OLE Automation Servers to Develop Solutions" 
technical article in the Microsoft Development Library.
Note that you must have the Speech application programming interface (API) Software Development Kit 
(SDK), its supporting engines, and its associated type library fully installed on your system to run this 
sample.
The VTXTDEMO sample was built with the Enterprise Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic version 4.0 and
