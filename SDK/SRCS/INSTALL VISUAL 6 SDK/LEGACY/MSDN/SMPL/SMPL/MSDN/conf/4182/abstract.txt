 The AC307 sample application augments the "Forty-Two Ways
 to Make DAO Faster --Programming to DAO Using Microsoft"
 technical presentation given by Michael Mee at the Tech*Ed
 Conference held March 27-31, 1995, in New Orleans,
 Louisiana.
 
 This presentation and the accompanying samples deal with
 making your data access objects (DAO) code run as fast as
 possible. All samples are built with and tested under
 Microsoft(R) Access(R) version 2.0, and most all of them
 apply equally to Microsoft Visual Basic(R).
 
 For more information, please refer to the technical
 presentation, which is available in the Microsoft
 Development Library (Conferences and Seminars, Tech*Ed,
 March 1995).
