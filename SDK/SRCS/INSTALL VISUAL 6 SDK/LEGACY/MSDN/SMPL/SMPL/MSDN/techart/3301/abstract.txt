 SC is a development tool that provides more detailed and
 accurate information about services than the two end-user
 utilities provided with the operating system. The Services
 Control Panel applet and the network command-line
 interface, NET.EXE, can determine whether a service is
 running, stopped, or paused. Although these tools are fine
 for completely debugged applications when everything is
 running smoothly, the information they provide about a
 service being developed can be misleading.
 
 SC lets you query the service status and retrieve the
 values stored in the status structure fields. Although the
 NET.EXE program and the Services Control Panel applet
 cannot provide you with the complete status of a service,
 the SC program will tell you the exact state of the
 service, as well as show the last checkpoint number and
 wait hint. The checkpoint can then be used as a debugging
 tool, because it provides a clear indication of how far
 the initialization progressed before the program froze.
