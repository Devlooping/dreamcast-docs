The XLAUTO sample demonstrates using OLE automation to create an Excel 
worksheet in a COleClientItem, add some data and create a chart using 
the Excel ChartWizard object. The application demonstrates creating 
chart, worksheet, chartobject, chartobjects and range objects provided 
by Excel. 

The steps to create this application from a default single AppWizard 
app with OLE container and automation support follow:

- Modify the CXlAutoView::OnInsertObject function and the corresponding 
  menu item to only insert an Excel worksheet object.

- Add standard handling of the inserted object as suggested in the 
  Contain tutorial from the OLE 2 Classes manual.
	- add m_rect member to CXlAutoCntrItem class
	- set m_rect in CXlAutoCntrItem constructor
	- modify OnChangeItemPosition() handler:
		- GetDocument()->UpdateAllViews(NULL);
		- m_rect = rectPos;
		- GetDocument()->SetModifiedFlag();
	- modify OnGetItemPosition()
		- rPosition - m_rect;
	- modify Serialize() to serialize m_rect
	- modify OnDraw(): m_pSelection->Draw(pDC, m_pSelection->m_rect)
	- OnLButtonDown handler

- Use ClassWizard to read Excel type library for the following objects:
	- Range in xlrange.cpp
	- Worksheet in xlsheet.cpp
	- Chart in xlchart.cpp
	- ChartObject in xlchtobj.cpp
	- ChartObjects in xlchtobs.cpp

- Comment out: VARIANT DialogBox() in xlrange.h and the function definition
  in xlrange.cpp, this causes compile errors because of a previous definition
  of the function name.

- Modify xlsheet.cpp and xlsheet.h to change the ChartObjects method of the
  worksheet object. The VBA for Excel reference suggests a version of the 
  ChartObjects method for the Worksheet object which takes no parameters. 
  However, this doesn't show up in the type library provided by Excel. 
  A new member function is created in xlsheet.cpp, Worksheet::ChartObjects().
  This method is needed to return a dispatch to a ChartObjects object, with 
  which we add a ChartObject object, then an actual Chart object.  This is 
  all done inside the CXlAutoView::OnAddstuffAddchart handler. 

- Add the header files for the Excel objects created by ClassWizard
	- in cntritem.h add: xlchart.h, xlchtobj.h, xlchtobs.h
	- in XlAutvw.cpp add: xlchtobs.h, xlchtobj.h, xlchart.h

- Add the following member functions to CXlAutoCntrItem class: (see the source
  code for more information on each function)
	- LPDISPATCH GetIDispatch()
	- void GetRange(Worksheet* pSheet, Range* pRange, const char *szCell1, const char *szCell2)
	- void SetRowHeadings(Range* pRange, char** szRows, int nRows)
	- void SetColHeadings(Range* pRange, char** szCols, int nCols)
	- void SetData(Range* pRange, long lDataArray[], int nRow, int nCol)
	- void SetYTDTotals(Worksheet* pSheet)

- Create CChartDlg class, derived from CDialog, with ClassWizard. This is used
  to select a chart type from a combobox control. A member variable, m_cbIndex,
  is added the CChartDlg definition, this will contain the index of the selected
  chart type in the combobox.

- Add "Add Stuff" menu to .rc file and corresponding functions with ClassWizard into
  the view class.
