 TEXTBOX: An Application Ready for OLE Enhancements
 
 TEXTBOX accompanies the "OLE for Idiots: A is for
 Attitude"msdn_ole2a technical article on the Microsoft
 Developer Network CD and forms the framework of an
 application that is developed into an OLE container
 application in subsequent articles. The application allows
 the creation of simple text objects in the client area of
 the main window. The objects can be dragged around and
 copied to and from the Clipboard. A file format is defined
 to store the set of displayed objects so a scene may be
 saved and reopened at a later time.
 
 TEXTBOX is written in C and was built using Microsoft (R)
 C 7.0. It requires the OLE 2.0 Software Development Kit
 libraries.
