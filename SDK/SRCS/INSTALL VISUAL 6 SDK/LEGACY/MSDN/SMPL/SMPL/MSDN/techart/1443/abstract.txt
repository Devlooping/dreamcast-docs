 TBSS: Uses OLE's Structured Storage
 
 TBSS accompanies the "OLE for Idiots: B is for
 Beginning"msdn_ole2b technical article on the Microsoft
 Developer Network CD and is based on the TEXTBOX sample
 application. TBSS shows how you can use OLE 2.0's
 structured storage in place of regular MS-DOS(R) file I/O
 in an application. The sample application can read and
 write structured storage files as well as files written by
 the older TEXTBOX application.
 
 TBSS is written in C and was built using Microsoft(R) C
 7.0. It requires the OLE 2.0 Software Development Kit
 (SDK) libraries. Note that this means you must already
 have the OLE 2.0 SDK installed before you attempt to build
 this application.
