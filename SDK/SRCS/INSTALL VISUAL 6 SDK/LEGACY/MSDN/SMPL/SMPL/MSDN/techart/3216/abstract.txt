 MarkPnt accompanies the "Creating Programs Without a
 Standard Windows User Interface Using Visual C++ and MFC"
 technical article in the Microsoft(R) Development Library.
 MarkPnt (Mark Paint) is a simple paint program that I
 developed for my young son Mark. It runs full screen with
 no caption, menus, or cursor. There is no keyboard
 interface, and the mouse buttons need not be used at all.
 
 The application uses sprite animation technology to
 simulate drawing with crayons on paper. The animation is
 done partly with direct pixel access to a device-
 independent bitmap (DIB) structure and partly with
 graphics device interface (GDI) operations on the same
 DIB.
 
 MarkPnt was built using Microsoft Visual C++(TM) version
 2.0 and the Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) under
 Microsoft Windows NT(TM). It is linked with the ANIMATE
 library, which is also available in the Development
 Library.
 
 This application will run on Microsoft Windows(R) version
 3.1 under Win32s(R) and WinG. It took three days to write
 and one to debug some WinG problems in my library.
