WIZARD: Uses the Wizard Control
WIZARD demonstrates a wizard control under the Microsoft(R)
Win32(R) application programming interface (API). Wizard
controls are part of the new common control dynamic-link
library, COMCTL32.DLL. Based on the property sheet control,
they are useful for applications that provide "wizards" to
help accomplish everyday tasks.
WIZARD implements a handy tool used for generating a
performance review. You are prompted for information such as
work habits and attitude, and the information gathered is
then translated into a form that manager-types can
appreciate.
WIZARD is a companion sample for the "We're Off to See the
Wizard"msdn_wizard technical article in the Microsoft
Development Library.
WIZARD is a Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK)
sample. It was built with Microsoft Visual C++(TM) version
2.1, the 32-bit development system for Microsoft Windows(R),
Windows 95, and Windows NT(TM), and was tested under Windows
95 and Windows NT version 3.51.
