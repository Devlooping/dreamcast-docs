 This Microsoft(R) Win32(R) sample application, built with
 Visual C++(TM) (32-bit) on Windows NT(TM) version 3.5
 (Beta), is a companion sample to the "Using CDialogBar in
 32-Bit MDI Applications" and "Simple Custom Controls for
 32-Bit Visual C++ Applications"  technical articles in the
 Microsoft Development Library.
 
 The FWTEST sample application shows how the CDialogBar
 class can be used to create simple Control Panel-like
 windows in a multiple-document interface (MDI)
 application. The sample demonstrates panels built with
 both standard Microsoft Windows(R) controls and a number
 of custom controls. One of the custom controls is an owner-
 drawn version of a standard Windows button control. The
 application also shows how to effectively handle
 CBN_SELCHANGE messages from combo-box controls.
 
 FWTEST was built and tested using Microsoft Visual C++
 version 2.0 on Microsoft Windows NT version 3.5.
 
 This sample application uses the ANIMATE library.
