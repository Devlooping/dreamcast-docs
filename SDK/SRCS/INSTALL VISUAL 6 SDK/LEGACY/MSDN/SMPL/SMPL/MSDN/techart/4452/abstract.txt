RDODEMO: Uses the Remote Data Object as an OLE Automation 
Server 
The RDODEMO sample application demonstrates the use of the Remote Data Object (RDO) version 1.0 as 
an OLE Automation server. This sample uses Microsoft(R) Visual Basic(R) version 4.0 as the OLE 
Automation controller. Developers can use this sample to gain a better understanding of how to implement 
OLE Automation with the Remote Data Object.
RDODEMO is a companion sample for the "Using Microsoft OLE Automation Servers to Develop 
Solutions" technical article in the Microsoft Development Library.
Note that you must have the Remote Data Object and its associated type library fully installed on your 
system to run this sample. The Remote Data Object is available only in the Enterprise Edition of Visual 
Basic version 4.0, and it requires the controller to be a 32-bit application.
The RDODEMO sample was built with the Enterprise Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic version 4.0 and 
tested on Microsoft Windows(R) 95.
