DragBez: Draws Connectors and Cables with CCable Class
DragBez is a Microsoft(R) Win32(R)-based sample that
includes a class called CCable. The original intent of this
class was to provide a way for drawing electrical connectors
and cables. Although the objects drawn by the class do not
look like electrical connectors and cables, the class
functions as a base class for which derived classes could
easily handle the correct drawing.
The CCable source files are part of the DragBez sample. This
sample is a single-document interface (SDI) application
generated by the application wizard in Microsoft Visual
C++(TM) version 2.1. Within the view source files, several
mouse event handlers utilize the CCable class, providing an
interactive way to create connectors and cables and to
modify their locations.
DragBez was built with Microsoft Visual C++ version 2.1 and
the Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) version 3.1,
and tested under Microsoft Windows NT(TM) version 3.5.
