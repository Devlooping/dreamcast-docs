STREAMS: Streams wave files using DirectSound

STREAMS illustrates the technique of streaming wave files with
DirectSound. Streaming is a technique of using a small buffer to
play a large file by filling the buffer with data from the file
at the same rate that data is taken from the buffer and played.
STREAMS is implemented with C++ and Microsoft Foundation Classes
(MFC). This is a lightweight (basic two object) implementation
of an MFC application.
