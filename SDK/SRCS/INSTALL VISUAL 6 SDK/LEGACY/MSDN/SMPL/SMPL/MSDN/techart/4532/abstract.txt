CGISPAWN: Intermediates Common Gateway Interface 
Compliance
CGISPAWN is a 32-bit Microsoft(R) Windows NT(TM) console application that enables 
common gateway interface (CGI) programs to be written in languages that do not support 
standard input-output (I/O).
A requirement of CGI is returning data to its client by writing to standard output (STDOUT). 
Some languages that would otherwise be very good for writing useful CGI applications do not 
support standard I/O. CGISPAWN resolves this dilemma, handling all standard I/O issues for 
non-CGI-compliant languages.
Note that there is very little error checking in this sample application. If you want to use 
CGISPAWN in a commercial or production situation, you should modify the source code 
appropriately to accommodate error conditions.
CGISPAWN is a sample application that accompanies the "CGISPAWN: A Utility for Use with 
HTML Forms" technical article in the Microsoft Development Library.
CGISPAWN was built with Microsoft Visual C++(TM) version 4.0, and was tested on Microsoft 
Windows NT version 3.51.
