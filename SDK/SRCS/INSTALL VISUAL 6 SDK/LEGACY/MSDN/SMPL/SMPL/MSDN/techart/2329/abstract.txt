 Chicago
 
 The TreeView sample application implements a simple tree
 view control in Chicago, which is the code name for the
 next version of the Microsoft(R) Windows(TM) operating
 system. The tree view control provides a way to display a
 hierarchical list of items. Each item has a label and
 (optionally) a bitmap associated with it. You’ve seen tree
 views before in the File Manager, where they display
 directory information, and in Microsoft Mail, where they
 represent mail folders.
 
 TreeView is a companion sample for the "Win32 Common
 Controls, Part 5: Image Lists and Tree View Windows"
 technical article in the Microsoft Development Library.
 
 TreeView was built and tested under Chicago; however, the
 common control dynamic-link library (COMCTL32.DLL) that is
 included with Chicago will also be supported under
 Win32s(TM) running on Windows 3.1 and Windows NT(TM) via
 redistributable DLLs (just as the common dialogs were
 provided for Windows 3.0). It is important to note that
 these new common controls are 32-bit only and will not be
 supported for 16-bit Windows environments.
 
 WARNING: The TreeView executable file was built and tested
 using the Chicago Preliminary Development Kit. The
 executable will run only on Chicago; it will not run under
 Windows 3.1 or Windows NT. If you have Chicago installed
 on your machine, but you have problems running this
 sample, copy the project files to your system using the
 button below, rebuild the project, and run the executable.
