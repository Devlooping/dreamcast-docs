 
 
 OF203: Demonstrate Microsoft Access and OLE Automation
 
 The OF203 sample applications augment the "Microsoft
 Access to Microsoft Office: Applied Integration
 Techniques" technical presentation given by Christine
 Solomon at the Tech*Ed Conference held March 27-31, 1995,
 in New Orleans, Louisiana.
 
 The PIVOT and BULKMAIL samples use OLE Automation. These
 applications address programming techniques and practices
 that can help you develop professional business
 applications that integrate functionality from more than
 one shrink-wrapped product.
 
 PIVOT calls on the Microsoft(R) Excel pivot table feature
 to serve as a reporting engine for Microsoft Access(R).
 
 BULKMAIL is a Microsoft Excel-based application that makes
 it easier to manage mailing list data in Microsoft Excel.
 The application communicates with a Word template when
 creating the mail merge letter.
 
 For more information, please refer to the technical
 presentation, which is also available in the Microsoft
 Development Library (Conferences and Seminars, Tech*Ed,
 March 1995).
