 MFC
 
 POP3 accompanies the "Creating 32-Bit Screen Savers with
 Visual C++ and MFC" technical article in the Microsoft(R)
 Development Library. This sample application shows you how
 to create a 32-bit screen saver for Microsoft Windows
 NT(TM) or Windows 95 using Visual C++(TM) version 2.0 and
 the Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC). POP3 uses
 simple animation techniques to create a really average
 screen saver.
 
 This sample uses classes from the Animate library, which
 is also available in the Development Library.
