 DRAGON: An OLE Application with Drag and Drop
 
 This sample application accompanies the "OLE for Idiots: D
 Is for Dragon"msdn_ole2d technical article on the
 Microsoft(R) Development Library and was developed from
 the BUCKET sample application. The DRAGON sample is a
 primitive object linking and embedding (OLE) container
 that allows objects to be dropped from other OLE
 applications. It also allows its own objects to be dragged
 away to unknown destinations for use by the evil empire.
 
 The sample application is written in C and was built using
 Microsoft C 7.0. It requires the OLE 2.0 Software
 Development Kit (SDK) libraries. Note that this means you
 must already have the OLE 2.0 SDK installed before you
 attempt to build this application. In addition to the
 standard OLE 2.0 files, it also requires the OLE2UI
 headers, library, and run-time dynamic-link library (DLL).
 The headers and library for OLE2UI can be found in
 \OLE2\SAMP\REL (if you used the default installation for
 the OLE 2.0 SDK). The run-time DLL is actually called
 OUTLUI.DLL and can be found in \OLE2\SAMP\OLE2UI. OLE2UI
 is not a regular part of the OLE 2.0 SDK. It was shipped
 as a sample DLL so that you could modify the text for
 international use. The name was intended to be unique to
 each application. The sample (OUTLUI) belongs to the
 OUTLINE sample application but is generally useful in
 testing sample applications.
 
 When you set up your environment variables for the OLE 2.0
 SDK, be sure to use the DEBUG versions of the DLLs to get
 the best testing of your application. If you let the SDK
 install in the default \OLE2 directory, your environment
 should contain:
 
 PATH= ...;\ole2\samp\rel;\ole2\rel\debug;\ole2\rel;...
 
 INCLUDE= ...;\ole2\rel;\ole2\samp\rel;...
 
 LIB= ...;\ole2\rel;\ole2\samp\rel;...
 
 NOTE: The path shown here is NOT the same as that
 recommended in the OLE 2.0 SDK setup.
