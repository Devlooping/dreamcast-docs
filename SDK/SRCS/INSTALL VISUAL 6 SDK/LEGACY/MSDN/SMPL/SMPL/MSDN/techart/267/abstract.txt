DDEExec: DDE Execute Command Server

DDEExec is a dynamic data exchange (DDE) server that
supports an Execute command set. The commands allow DDE
client applications to draw pictures in the main window of
the server. The following sample client applications use
the DDEExec server and are included with this application:

>  EXEC is a Visual Basic(TM) version 2.0 application that
allows any Execute command to be sent to a given topic of
a DDE server. This sample client application tests the
basic command set of a DDE server and ensures that the
server reports command errors correctly.

>  BUNNY is a Visual Basic 2.0 application that uses the
server to draw a picture of a bunny rabbit.

>  WBUNNY.DOC is a Word for Windows(TM) document based on
the WBUNNY.DOT template that uses Word's embedded Basic
language to draw yet another bunny picture.

>  XLART.XLM is a sample Microsoft Excel macro sheet that
shows how you can use Microsoft Excel as a DDE client to
draw fascinatingly complex pictures.

DDEExec was built and tested under Microsoft Windows
version 3.1.
