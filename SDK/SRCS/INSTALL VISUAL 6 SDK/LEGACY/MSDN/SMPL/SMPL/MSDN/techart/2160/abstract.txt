 ANIM32: 32-Bit Sprite Animation Using MFC
 
 ANIM32 is an application that shows how sprite animation
 can be done with Microsoft(R) Visual C++(TM) and the
 Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) version 1.0 on
 Windows NT(TM). The sample code contains C++ classes for
 manipulating device-independent bitmaps (DIBs), palettes,
 and sprites, and a view class that uses a DIB for off-
 screen buffering. ANIM32 accompanies the "Animation in
 Win32"msdn_anim32 technical article in the Microsoft
 Development Library.
