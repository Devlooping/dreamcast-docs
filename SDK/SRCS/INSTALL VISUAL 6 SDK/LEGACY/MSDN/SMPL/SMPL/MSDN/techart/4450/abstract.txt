PROJDEMO: Uses Microsoft Project as an OLE Automation 
Server
The PROJDEMO sample application demonstrates the use of Microsoft(R) Project version 4.1 as an OLE 
Automation server. This sample uses Microsoft Visual Basic(R) version 4.0 as the OLE Automation 
controller. Developers can use this sample to gain a better understanding of how to implement OLE 
Automation with Microsoft Project.
PROJDEMO is a companion sample for the "Using Microsoft OLE Automation Servers to Develop 
Solutions" technical article in the Microsoft Development Library.
Note that you must have Microsoft Project 4.1 and its associated type library fully installed on your system 
to run this sample.
The PROJDEMO sample was built with the Enterprise Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic version 4.0 and 
tested on Microsoft Windows(R) 95.
