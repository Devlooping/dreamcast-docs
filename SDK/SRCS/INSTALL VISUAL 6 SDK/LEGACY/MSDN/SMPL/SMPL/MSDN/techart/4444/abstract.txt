MAPIDEMO: Uses the OLE Messaging Object as an OLE 
Automation Server
The MAPIDEMO sample application demonstrates the use of the OLE Messaging Object version 1.0 as an 
OLE Automation server. This sample uses Microsoft(R) Visual Basic(R) version 4.0 as the OLE 
Automation controller. Developers can use this sample to gain a better understanding of how to implement 
OLE Automation with the OLE Messaging Object.
MAPIDEMO is a companion sample for the "Using Microsoft OLE Automation Servers to Develop 
Solutions" technical article in the Microsoft Development Library.
Note that you must have the OLE Messaging Object and its associated type libraries fully installed on your 
system to run this sample. They are available as part of the Win32(R) Software Development Kit (SDK) in 
the Microsoft Development Library.
The MAPIDEMO sample was built with the Enterprise Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic version 4.0 and 
tested on Microsoft Windows(R) 95.
