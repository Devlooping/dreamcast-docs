INTRORDO: Measures the Difference in Performance Between the 
RDO and the DAO
The INTRORDO sample application demonstrates the different options available with the Data Access 
Object (DAO) and Remote Data Object (RDO) when you use Visual Basic(R), Enterprise Edition version 
4.0 running on Microsoft(R) Windows(R) version 3.1, Windows NT(TM), or Windows 95. The 
INTRORDO sample implements a test platform that allows the performance of each object, with its many 
options, to be recorded in a log file. Developers can use this sample to gain a better understanding of the 
objects, their options, and the performance consequences of various decisions.
INTRORDO is a companion sample for the "Introduction to Using the Remote Data Object" technical 
article in the Microsoft Development Library.
The INTRORDO sample was built with Microsoft Visual Basic, Enterprise Edition version 4.0, and tested 
under Microsoft Windows NT SQL Server version 6.0.
